* About

This project contains:

+ A java implement of homomorphic encryption algorithm: Paillier
+ An experimental implement of the Hadoop wordcount program using
  homomorphic encryption system Paillier.
+ Scripts to run the whole process: 
  1. encrypt data
  2. start Hadoop/HDFS/YARN and push data to HDFS
  3. decrypt data
+ Hadoop sample configuration
+ Hadoop fully distributed mode configuration guide (by Jonathan Lin)

* What are those folders

+ PaillierJava: homomorphic algorithm java implementation
+ dwc: secured distributed word count program
+ encryption: encryption & decryption program
+ hadoop-etc: Hadoop sample conf files
+ example: the how process to run a homomorphic encrypted word count

* Prerequisite

** Environment

+ JAVA 1.8
+ Hadoop 2.7.3

** Configuration

1. Review all the *.sh script in this proj, replace all the absolute address
   in files. E.g. replace `hd="/home/stumble/learn/UCLA/CS211/hadoop/hd"` with 
   your hadoop folder.

2. Execute all the compile.sh
