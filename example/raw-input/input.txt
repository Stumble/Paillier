in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth
and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters
and god said let there be light and there was light
and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness
and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day
and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters
and god made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so
and god called the firmament heaven and the evening and the morning were the second day
and god said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so
and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of the waters called he seas and god saw that it was good
and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so
and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good
and the evening and the morning were the third day
and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years
and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so
and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also
and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth
and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good
and the evening and the morning were the fourth day
and god said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven
and god created great whales and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged fowl after his kind and god saw that it was good
and god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let fowl multiply in the earth
and the evening and the morning were the fifth day
and god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so
and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and god saw that it was good
and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth
so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them
and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth
and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat
and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life i have given every green herb for meat and it was so
and god saw every thing that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day
thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them
and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made
and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made
these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens
and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground
but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground
and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul
and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed
and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil
and a river went out of eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted and became into four heads
the name of the first is pison that is it which compasseth the whole land of havilah where there is gold
and the gold of that land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone
and the name of the second river is gihon the same is it that compasseth the whole land of ethiopia
and the name of the third river is hiddekel that is it which goeth toward the east of assyria and the fourth river is euphrates
and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it
and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die
and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him an help meet for him
and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof
and adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found an help meet for him
and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof
and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man
and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh
and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed
now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden
and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die
and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die
for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil
and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat
and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons
and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden
and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou
and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself
and he said who told thee that thou wast naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat
and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat
and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat
and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life
and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee
and unto adam he said because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life
thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return
and adam called his wife's name eve because she was the mother of all living
unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothed them
and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever
therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken
so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life
and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bare cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord
and she again bare his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground
and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord
and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering
but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell
and the lord said unto cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen
if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him
and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him
and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brother's keeper
and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground
and now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand
when thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth
and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i can bear
behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me
and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a mark upon cain lest any finding him should kill him
and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden
and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch
and unto enoch was born irad and irad begat mehujael and mehujael begat methusael and methusael begat lamech
and lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one was adah and the name of the other zillah
and adah bare jabal he was the father of such as dwell in tents and of such as have cattle
and his brother's name was jubal he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ
and zillah she also bare tubalcain an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron and the sister of tubalcain was naamah
and lamech said unto his wives adah and zillah hear my voice ye wives of lamech hearken unto my speech for i have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurt
if cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly lamech seventy and sevenfold
and adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called his name seth for god said she hath appointed me another seed instead of abel whom cain slew
and to seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name enos then began men to call upon the name of the lord
this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god created man in the likeness of god made he him
male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created
and adam lived an hundred and thirty years and begat a son in his own likeness after his image and called his name seth
and the days of adam after he had begotten seth were eight hundred years and he begat sons and daughters
and all the days that adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years and he died
and seth lived an hundred and five years and begat enos
and seth lived after he begat enos eight hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of seth were nine hundred and twelve years and he died
and enos lived ninety years and begat cainan
and enos lived after he begat cainan eight hundred and fifteen years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of enos were nine hundred and five years and he died
and cainan lived seventy years and begat mahalaleel
and cainan lived after he begat mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of cainan were nine hundred and ten years and he died
and mahalaleel lived sixty and five years and begat jared
and mahalaleel lived after he begat jared eight hundred and thirty years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years and he died
and jared lived an hundred sixty and two years and he begat enoch
and jared lived after he begat enoch eight hundred years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of jared were nine hundred sixty and two years and he died
and enoch lived sixty and five years and begat methuselah
and enoch walked with god after he begat methuselah three hundred years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of enoch were three hundred sixty and five years
and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him
and methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years and begat lamech
and methuselah lived after he begat lamech seven hundred eighty and two years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years and he died
and lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years and begat a son
and he called his name noah saying this same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands because of the ground which the lord hath cursed
and lamech lived after he begat noah five hundred ninety and five years and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years and he died
and noah was five hundred years old and noah begat shem ham and japheth
and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them
that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose
and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years
there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown
and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually
and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart
and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them
but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord
these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and noah walked with god
and noah begat three sons shem ham and japheth
the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence
and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth
and god said unto noah the end of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth
make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in the ark and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch
and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits the breadth of it fifty cubits and the height of it thirty cubits
a window shalt thou make to the ark and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof with lower second and third stories shalt thou make it
and behold i even i do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven and every thing that is in the earth shall die
but with thee will i establish my covenant and thou shalt come into the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons wives with thee
and of every living thing of all flesh two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shall be male and female
of fowls after their kind and of cattle after their kind of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind two of every sort shall come unto thee to keep them alive
and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten and thou shalt gather it to thee and it shall be for food for thee and for them
thus did noah according to all that god commanded him so did he
and the lord said unto noah come thou and all thy house into the ark for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation
of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens the male and his female and of beasts that are not clean by two the male and his female
of fowls also of the air by sevens the male and the female to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth
for yet seven days and i will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights and every living substance that i have made will i destroy from off the face of the earth
and noah did according unto all that the lord commanded him
and noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth
and noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood
of clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth
there went in two and two unto noah into the ark the male and the female as god had commanded noah
and it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth
in the six hundredth year of noah's life in the second month the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened
and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights
in the selfsame day entered noah and shem and ham and japheth the sons of noah and noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark
they and every beast after his kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind every bird of every sort
and they went in unto noah into the ark two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life
and they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as god had commanded him and the lord shut him in
and the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters increased and bare up the ark and it was lift up above the earth
and the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth and the ark went upon the face of the waters
and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered
fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains were covered
and all flesh died that moved upon the earth both of fowl and of cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and every man
all in whose nostrils was the breath of life of all that was in the dry land died
and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground both man and cattle and the creeping things and the fowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth and noah only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark
and the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days
and god remembered noah and every living thing and all the cattle that was with him in the ark and god made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters asswaged
the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was restrained
and the waters returned from off the earth continually and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated
and the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of the month upon the mountains of ararat
and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in the tenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of the mountains seen
and it came to pass at the end of forty days that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made
and he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth
also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground
but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the ark
and he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark
and the dove came in to him in the evening and lo in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off so noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth
and he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove which returned not again unto him any more
and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from off the earth and noah removed the covering of the ark and looked and behold the face of the ground was dry
and in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the month was the earth dried
and god spake unto noah saying
go forth of the ark thou and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with thee
bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh both of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth
and noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him
every beast every creeping thing and every fowl and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds went forth out of the ark
and noah builded an altar unto the lord and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the altar
and the lord smelled a sweet savour and the lord said in his heart i will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth neither will i again smite any more every thing living as i have done
while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease
and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth
and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are they delivered
every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the green herb have i given you all things
but flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall ye not eat
and surely your blood of your lives will i require at the hand of every beast will i require it and at the hand of man at the hand of every man's brother will i require the life of man
whoso sheddeth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god made he man
and you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein
and god spake unto noah and to his sons with him saying
and i behold i establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you
and with every living creature that is with you of the fowl of the cattle and of every beast of the earth with you from all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth
and i will establish my covenant with you neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth
and god said this is the token of the covenant which i make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations
i do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth
and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud
and i will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh
and the bow shall be in the cloud and i will look upon it that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth
and god said unto noah this is the token of the covenant which i have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth
and the sons of noah that went forth of the ark were shem and ham and japheth and ham is the father of canaan
these are the three sons of noah and of them was the whole earth overspread
and noah began to be an husbandman and he planted a vineyard
and he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tent
and ham the father of canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren without
and shem and japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father and their faces were backward and they saw not their father's nakedness
and noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had done unto him
and he said cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren
and he said blessed be the lord god of shem and canaan shall be his servant
god shall enlarge japheth and he shall dwell in the tents of shem and canaan shall be his servant
and noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years
and all the days of noah were nine hundred and fifty years and he died
now these are the generations of the sons of noah shem ham and japheth and unto them were sons born after the flood
the sons of japheth gomer and magog and madai and javan and tubal and meshech and tiras
and the sons of gomer ashkenaz and riphath and togarmah
and the sons of javan elishah and tarshish kittim and dodanim
by these were the isles of the gentiles divided in their lands every one after his tongue after their families in their nations
and the sons of ham cush and mizraim and phut and canaan
and the sons of cush seba and havilah and sabtah and raamah and sabtechah and the sons of raamah sheba and dedan
and cush begat nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth
he was a mighty hunter before the lord wherefore it is said even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord
and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and erech and accad and calneh in the land of shinar
out of that land went forth asshur and builded nineveh and the city rehoboth and calah
and resen between nineveh and calah the same is a great city
and mizraim begat ludim and anamim and lehabim and naphtuhim
and pathrusim and casluhim out of whom came philistim and caphtorim
and canaan begat sidon his first born and heth
and the jebusite and the amorite and the girgasite
and the hivite and the arkite and the sinite
and the arvadite and the zemarite and the hamathite and afterward were the families of the canaanites spread abroad
and the border of the canaanites was from sidon as thou comest to gerar unto gaza as thou goest unto sodom and gomorrah and admah and zeboim even unto lasha
these are the sons of ham after their families after their tongues in their countries and in their nations
unto shem also the father of all the children of eber the brother of japheth the elder even to him were children born
the children of shem elam and asshur and arphaxad and lud and aram
and the children of aram uz and hul and gether and mash
and arphaxad begat salah and salah begat eber
and unto eber were born two sons the name of one was peleg for in his days was the earth divided and his brother's name was joktan
and joktan begat almodad and sheleph and hazarmaveth and jerah
and hadoram and uzal and diklah
and obal and abimael and sheba
and ophir and havilah and jobab all these were the sons of joktan
and their dwelling was from mesha as thou goest unto sephar a mount of the east
these are the sons of shem after their families after their tongues in their lands after their nations
these are the families of the sons of noah after their generations in their nations and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood
and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech
and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of shinar and they dwelt there
and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for morter
and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth
and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded
and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do
go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech
so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city
therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth
these are the generations of shem shem was an hundred years old and begat arphaxad two years after the flood
and shem lived after he begat arphaxad five hundred years and begat sons and daughters
and arphaxad lived five and thirty years and begat salah
and arphaxad lived after he begat salah four hundred and three years and begat sons and daughters
and salah lived thirty years and begat eber
and salah lived after he begat eber four hundred and three years and begat sons and daughters
and eber lived four and thirty years and begat peleg
and eber lived after he begat peleg four hundred and thirty years and begat sons and daughters
and peleg lived thirty years and begat reu
and peleg lived after he begat reu two hundred and nine years and begat sons and daughters
and reu lived two and thirty years and begat serug
and reu lived after he begat serug two hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters
and serug lived thirty years and begat nahor
and serug lived after he begat nahor two hundred years and begat sons and daughters
and nahor lived nine and twenty years and begat terah
and nahor lived after he begat terah an hundred and nineteen years and begat sons and daughters
and terah lived seventy years and begat abram nahor and haran
now these are the generations of terah terah begat abram nahor and haran and haran begat lot
and haran died before his father terah in the land of his nativity in ur of the chaldees
and abram and nahor took them wives the name of abram's wife was sarai and the name of nahor's wife milcah the daughter of haran the father of milcah and the father of iscah
but sarai was barren she had no child
and terah took abram his son and lot the son of haran his son's son and sarai his daughter in law his son abram's wife and they went forth with them from ur of the chaldees to go into the land of canaan and they came unto haran and dwelt there
and the days of terah were two hundred and five years and terah died in haran
now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will shew thee
and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing
and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed
so abram departed as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of haran
and abram took sarai his wife and lot his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in haran and they went forth to go into the land of canaan and into the land of canaan they came
and abram passed through the land unto the place of sichem unto the plain of moreh and the canaanite was then in the land
and the lord appeared unto abram and said unto thy seed will i give this land and there builded he an altar unto the lord who appeared unto him
and he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of bethel and pitched his tent having bethel on the west and hai on the east and there he builded an altar unto the lord and called upon the name of the lord
and abram journeyed going on still toward the south
and there was a famine in the land and abram went down into egypt to sojourn there for the famine was grievous in the land
and it came to pass when he was come near to enter into egypt that he said unto sarai his wife behold now i know that thou art a fair woman to look upon
therefore it shall come to pass when the egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is his wife and they will kill me but they will save thee alive
say i pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee
and it came to pass that when abram was come into egypt the egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair
the princes also of pharaoh saw her and commended her before pharaoh and the woman was taken into pharaoh's house
and he entreated abram well for her sake and he had sheep and oxen and he asses and menservants and maidservants and she asses and camels
and the lord plagued pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of sarai abram's wife
and pharaoh called abram and said what is this that thou hast done unto me why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife
why saidst thou she is my sister so i might have taken her to me to wife now therefore behold thy wife take her and go thy way
and pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they sent him away and his wife and all that he had
and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the south
and abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold
and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel and hai
unto the place of the altar which he had made there at the first and there abram called on the name of the lord
and lot also which went with abram had flocks and herds and tents
and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together
and there was a strife between the herdmen of abram's cattle and the herdmen of lot's cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelled then in the land
and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be brethren
is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me if thou wilt take the left hand then i will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left
and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of jordan that it was well watered every where before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou comest unto zoar
then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other
abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward sodom
but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly
and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward
for all the land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed for ever
and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered
arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for i will give it unto thee
then abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of mamre which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord
and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinar arioch king of ellasar chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of nations
that these made war with bera king of sodom and with birsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah and shemeber king of zeboiim and the king of bela which is zoar
all these were joined together in the vale of siddim which is the salt sea
twelve years they served chedorlaomer and in the thirteenth year they rebelled
and in the fourteenth year came chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him and smote the rephaims in ashteroth karnaim and the zuzims in ham and the emims in shaveh kiriathaim
and the horites in their mount seir unto elparan which is by the wilderness
and they returned and came to enmishpat which is kadesh and smote all the country of the amalekites and also the amorites that dwelt in hazezontamar
and there went out the king of sodom and the king of gomorrah and the king of admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of bela the same is zoar and they joined battle with them in the vale of siddim
with chedorlaomer the king of elam and with tidal king of nations and amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasar four kings with five
and the vale of siddim was full of slimepits and the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled and fell there and they that remained fled to the mountain
and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their victuals and went their way
and they took lot abram's brother's son who dwelt in sodom and his goods and departed
and there came one that had escaped and told abram the hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of mamre the amorite brother of eshcol and brother of aner and these were confederate with abram
and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house three hundred and eighteen and pursued them unto dan
and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smote them and pursued them unto hobah which is on the left hand of damascus
and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people
and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with him at the valley of shaveh which is the king's dale
and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god
and he blessed him and said blessed be abram of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth
and blessed be the most high god which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all
and the king of sodom said unto abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself
and abram said to the king of sodom i have lift up mine hand unto the lord the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth
that i will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet and that i will not take any thing that is thine lest thou shouldest say i have made abram rich
save only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men which went with me aner eshcol and mamre let them take their portion
after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward
and abram said lord god what wilt thou give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus
and abram said behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir
and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir
and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be
and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness
and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of ur of the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it
and he said lord god whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it
and he said unto him take me an heifer of three years old and a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtledove and a young pigeon
and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not
and when the fowls came down upon the carcases abram drove them away
and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram and lo an horror of great darkness fell upon him
and he said unto abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred years
and also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance
and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age
but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full
and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces
in the same day the lord made a covenant with abram saying unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt unto the great river the river euphrates
the kenites and the kenizzites and the kadmonites
and the hittites and the perizzites and the rephaims
and the amorites and the canaanites and the girgashites and the jebusites
now sarai abram's wife bare him no children and she had an handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar
and sarai said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrained me from bearing i pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that i may obtain children by her and abram hearkened to the voice of sarai
and sarai abram's wife took hagar her maid the egyptian after abram had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to her husband abram to be his wife
and he went in unto hagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes
and sarai said unto abram my wrong be upon thee i have given my maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i was despised in her eyes the lord judge between me and thee
but abram said unto sarai behold thy maid is in thy hand do to her as it pleaseth thee and when sarai dealt hardly with her she fled from her face
and the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to shur
and he said hagar sarai's maid whence camest thou and whither wilt thou go and she said i flee from the face of my mistress sarai
and the angel of the lord said unto her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands
and the angel of the lord said unto her i will multiply thy seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude
and the angel of the lord said unto her behold thou art with child and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name ishmael because the lord hath heard thy affliction
and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren
and she called the name of the lord that spake unto her thou god seest me for she said have i also here looked after him that seeth me
wherefore the well was called beerlahairoi behold it is between kadesh and bered
and hagar bare abram a son and abram called his son's name which hagar bare ishmael
and abram was fourscore and six years old when hagar bare ishmael to abram
and when abram was ninety years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect
and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly
and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying
as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations
neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee
and i will make thee exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee
and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee
and i will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god
and god said unto abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations
this is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised
and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you
and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed
he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant
and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my covenant
and god said unto abraham as for sarai thy wife thou shalt not call her name sarai but sarah shall her name be
and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea i will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations kings of people shall be of her
then abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old and shall sarah that is ninety years old bear
and abraham said unto god o that ishmael might live before thee
and god said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him
and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation
but my covenant will i establish with isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year
and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham
and abraham took ishmael his son and all that were born in his house and all that were bought with his money every male among the men of abraham's house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day as god had said unto him
and abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin
and ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin
in the selfsame day was abraham circumcised and ishmael his son
and all the men of his house born in the house and bought with money of the stranger were circumcised with him
and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamre and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day
and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground
and said my lord if now i have found favour in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant
let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree
and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are ye come to your servant and they said so do as thou hast said
and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the hearth
and abraham ran unto the herd and fetcht a calf tender and good and gave it unto a young man and he hasted to dress it
and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat
and they said unto him where is sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent
and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him
now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women
therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also
and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i of a surety bear a child which am old
is any thing too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son
then sarah denied saying i laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou didst laugh
and the men rose up from thence and looked toward sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way
and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do
seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him
for i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him
and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous
i will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not i will know
and the men turned their faces from thence and went toward sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord
and abraham drew near and said wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked
peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein
that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right
and the lord said if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city then i will spare all the place for their sakes
and abraham answered and said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord which am but dust and ashes
peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five and he said if i find there forty and five i will not destroy it
and he spake unto him yet again and said peradventure there shall be forty found there and he said i will not do it for forty's sake
and he said unto him oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak peradventure there shall thirty be found there and he said i will not do it if i find thirty there
and he said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord peradventure there shall be twenty found there and he said i will not destroy it for twenty's sake
and he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak yet but this once peradventure ten shall be found there and he said i will not destroy it for ten's sake
and the lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with abraham and abraham returned unto his place
and there came two angels to sodom at even and lot sat in the gate of sodom and lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground
and he said behold now my lords turn in i pray you into your servant's house and tarry all night and wash your feet and ye shall rise up early and go on your ways and they said nay but we will abide in the street all night
and he pressed upon them greatly and they turned in unto him and entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread and they did eat
but before they lay down the men of the city even the men of sodom compassed the house round both old and young all the people from every quarter
and they called unto lot and said unto him where are the men which came in to thee this night bring them out unto us that we may know them
and lot went out at the door unto them and shut the door after him
and said i pray you brethren do not so wickedly
behold now i have two daughters which have not known man let me i pray you bring them out unto you and do ye to them as is good in your eyes only unto these men do nothing for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof
and they said stand back and they said again this one fellow came in to sojourn and he will needs be a judge now will we deal worse with thee than with them and they pressed sore upon the man even lot and came near to break the door
but the men put forth their hand and pulled lot into the house to them and shut to the door
and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door
and the men said unto lot hast thou here any besides son in law and thy sons and thy daughters and whatsoever thou hast in the city bring them out of this place
for we will destroy this place because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the lord and the lord hath sent us to destroy it
and lot went out and spake unto his sons in law which married his daughters and said up get you out of this place for the lord will destroy this city but he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law
and when the morning arose then the angels hastened lot saying arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city
and while he lingered the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the lord being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him without the city
and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed
and lot said unto them oh not so my lord
behold now thy servant hath found grace in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy mercy which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life and i cannot escape to the mountain lest some evil take me and i die
behold now this city is near to flee unto and it is a little one oh let me escape thither is it not a little one and my soul shall live
and he said unto him see i have accepted thee concerning this thing also that i will not overthrow this city for the which thou hast spoken
haste thee escape thither for i cannot do anything till thou be come thither therefore the name of the city was called zoar
the sun was risen upon the earth when lot entered into zoar
then the lord rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven
and he overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground
but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt
and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the lord
and he looked toward sodom and gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and beheld and lo the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace
and it came to pass when god destroyed the cities of the plain that god remembered abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt
and lot went up out of zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in zoar and he dwelt in a cave he and his two daughters
and the firstborn said unto the younger our father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth
come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father
and they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose
and it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto the younger behold i lay yesternight with my father let us make him drink wine this night also and go thou in and lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father
and they made their father drink wine that night also and the younger arose and lay with him and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose
thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father
and the first born bare a son and called his name moab the same is the father of the moabites unto this day
and the younger she also bare a son and called his name benammi the same is the father of the children of ammon unto this day
and abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country and dwelled between kadesh and shur and sojourned in gerar
and abraham said of sarah his wife she is my sister and abimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah
but god came to abimelech in a dream by night and said to him behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou hast taken for she is a man's wife
but abimelech had not come near her and he said lord wilt thou slay also a righteous nation
said he not unto me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have i done this
and god said unto him in a dream yea i know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart for i also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffered i thee not to touch her
now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thine
therefore abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ears and the men were sore afraid
then abimelech called abraham and said unto him what hast thou done unto us and what have i offended thee that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done
and abimelech said unto abraham what sawest thou that thou hast done this thing
and abraham said because i thought surely the fear of god is not in this place and they will slay me for my wife's sake
and yet indeed she is my sister she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife
and it came to pass when god caused me to wander from my father's house that i said unto her this is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me at every place whither we shall come say of me he is my brother
and abimelech took sheep and oxen and menservants and womenservants and gave them unto abraham and restored him sarah his wife
and abimelech said behold my land is before thee dwell where it pleaseth thee
and unto sarah he said behold i have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver behold he is to thee a covering of the eyes unto all that are with thee and with all other thus she was reproved
so abraham prayed unto god and god healed abimelech and his wife and his maidservants and they bare children
for the lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of abimelech because of sarah abraham's wife
and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken
for sarah conceived and bare abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him
and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom sarah bare to him isaac
and abraham circumcised his son isaac being eight days old as god had commanded him
and abraham was an hundred years old when his son isaac was born unto him
and sarah said god hath made me to laugh so that all that hear will laugh with me
and she said who would have said unto abraham that sarah should have given children suck for i have born him a son in his old age
and the child grew and was weaned and abraham made a great feast the same day that isaac was weaned
and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian which she had born unto abraham mocking
wherefore she said unto abraham cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son even with isaac
and the thing was very grievous in abraham's sight because of his son
and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman in all that sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in isaac shall thy seed be called
and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation because he is thy seed
and abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it unto hagar putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of beersheba
and the water was spent in the bottle and she cast the child under one of the shrubs
and she went and sat her down over against him a good way off as it were a bow shot for she said let me not see the death of the child and she sat over against him and lift up her voice and wept
and god heard the voice of the lad and the angel of god called to hagar out of heaven and said unto her what aileth thee hagar fear not for god hath heard the voice of the lad where he is
arise lift up the lad and hold him in thine hand for i will make him a great nation
and god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink
and god was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer
and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran and his mother took him a wife out of the land of egypt
and it came to pass at that time that abimelech and phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto abraham saying god is with thee in all that thou doest
now therefore swear unto me here by god that thou wilt not deal falsely with me nor with my son nor with my son's son but according to the kindness that i have done unto thee thou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned
and abraham said i will swear
and abraham reproved abimelech because of a well of water which abimelech's servants had violently taken away
and abimelech said i wot not who hath done this thing neither didst thou tell me neither yet heard i of it but to day
and abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto abimelech and both of them made a covenant
and abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves
and abimelech said unto abraham what mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves
and he said for these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand that they may be a witness unto me that i have digged this well
wherefore he called that place beersheba because there they sware both of them
thus they made a covenant at beersheba then abimelech rose up and phichol the chief captain of his host and they returned into the land of the philistines
and abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called there on the name of the lord the everlasting god
and abraham sojourned in the philistines land many days
and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am
and he said take now thy son thine only son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of
and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which god had told him
then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off
and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you
and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together
and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering
and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together
and they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood
and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son
and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i
and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou any thing unto him for now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me
and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son
and abraham called the name of that place jehovahjireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen
and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time
and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thine only son
that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies
and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice
so abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went together to beersheba and abraham dwelt at beersheba
and it came to pass after these things that it was told abraham saying behold milcah she hath also born children unto thy brother nahor
huz his firstborn and buz his brother and kemuel the father of aram
and chesed and hazo and pildash and jidlaph and bethuel
and bethuel begat rebekah these eight milcah did bear to nahor abraham's brother
and his concubine whose name was reumah she bare also tebah and gaham and thahash and maachah
and sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old these were the years of the life of sarah
and sarah died in kirjatharba the same is hebron in the land of canaan and abraham came to mourn for sarah and to weep for her
and abraham stood up from before his dead and spake unto the sons of heth saying
i am a stranger and a sojourner with you give me a possession of a buryingplace with you that i may bury my dead out of my sight
and the children of heth answered abraham saying unto him
hear us my lord thou art a mighty prince among us in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre but that thou mayest bury thy dead
and abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land even to the children of heth
and he communed with them saying if it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and intreat for me to ephron the son of zohar
that he may give me the cave of machpelah which he hath which is in the end of his field for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you
and ephron dwelt among the children of heth and ephron the hittite answered abraham in the audience of the children of heth even of all that went in at the gate of his city saying
nay my lord hear me the field give i thee and the cave that is therein i give it thee in the presence of the sons of my people give i it thee bury thy dead
and abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land
and he spake unto ephron in the audience of the people of the land saying but if thou wilt give it i pray thee hear me i will give thee money for the field take it of me and i will bury my dead there
and ephron answered abraham saying unto him
my lord hearken unto me the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver what is that betwixt me and thee bury therefore thy dead
and abraham hearkened unto ephron and abraham weighed to ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of heth four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchant
and the field of ephron which was in machpelah which was before mamre the field and the cave which was therein and all the trees that were in the field that were in all the borders round about were made sure
unto abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of heth before all that went in at the gate of his city
and after this abraham buried sarah his wife in the cave of the field of machpelah before mamre the same is hebron in the land of canaan
and the field and the cave that is therein were made sure unto abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of heth
and abraham was old and well stricken in age and the lord had blessed abraham in all things
and abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh
and i will make thee swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the canaanites among whom i dwell
but thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son isaac
and the servant said unto him peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must i needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest
and abraham said unto him beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again
the lord god of heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me and that sware unto me saying unto thy seed will i give this land he shall send his angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then thou shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my son thither again
and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and sware to him concerning that matter
and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to mesopotamia unto the city of nahor
and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out to draw water
and he said o lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and shew kindness unto my master abraham
behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water
and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy pitcher i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master
and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebekah came out who was born to bethuel son of milcah the wife of nahor abraham's brother with her pitcher upon her shoulder
and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her pitcher and came up
and the servant ran to meet her and said let me i pray thee drink a little water of thy pitcher
and she said drink my lord and she hasted and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink
and when she had done giving him drink she said i will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking
and she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran again unto the well to draw water and drew for all his camels
and the man wondering at her held his peace to wit whether the lord had made his journey prosperous or not
and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold
and said whose daughter art thou tell me i pray thee is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in
and she said unto him i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah which she bare unto nahor
she said moreover unto him we have both straw and provender enough and room to lodge in
and the man bowed down his head and worshipped the lord
and he said blessed be the lord god of my master abraham who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth i being in the way the lord led me to the house of my master's brethren
and the damsel ran and told them of her mother's house these things
and rebekah had a brother and his name was laban and laban ran out unto the man unto the well
and it came to pass when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands and when he heard the words of rebekah his sister saying thus spake the man unto me that he came unto the man and behold he stood by the camels at the well
and he said come in thou blessed of the lord wherefore standest thou without for i have prepared the house and room for the camels
and the man came into the house and he ungirded his camels and gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet and the men's feet that were with him
and there was set meat before him to eat but he said i will not eat until i have told mine errand and he said speak on
and he said i am abraham's servant
and the lord hath blessed my master greatly and he is become great and he hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and menservants and maidservants and camels and asses
and sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old and unto him hath he given all that he hath
and my master made me swear saying thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i dwell
but thou shalt go unto my father's house and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son
and i said unto my master peradventure the woman will not follow me
and he said unto me the lord before whom i walk will send his angel with thee and prosper thy way and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred and of my father's house
then shalt thou be clear from this my oath when thou comest to my kindred and if they give not thee one thou shalt be clear from my oath
and i came this day unto the well and said o lord god of my master abraham if now thou do prosper my way which i go
behold i stand by the well of water and it shall come to pass that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water and i say to her give me i pray thee a little water of thy pitcher to drink
and she say to me both drink thou and i will also draw for thy camels let the same be the woman whom the lord hath appointed out for my master's son
and before i had done speaking in mine heart behold rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder and she went down unto the well and drew water and i said unto her let me drink i pray thee
and she made haste and let down her pitcher from her shoulder and said drink and i will give thy camels drink also so i drank and she made the camels drink also
and i asked her and said whose daughter art thou and she said the daughter of bethuel nahor's son whom milcah bare unto him and i put the earring upon her face and the bracelets upon her hands
and i bowed down my head and worshipped the lord and blessed the lord god of my master abraham which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son
and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master tell me and if not tell me that i may turn to the right hand or to the left
then laban and bethuel answered and said the thing proceedeth from the lord we cannot speak unto thee bad or good
behold rebekah is before thee take her and go and let her be thy master's son's wife as the lord hath spoken
and it came to pass that when abraham's servant heard their words he worshipped the lord bowing himself to the earth
and the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and gave them to rebekah he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things
and they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him and tarried all night and they rose up in the morning and he said send me away unto my master
and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days at the least ten after that she shall go
and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the lord hath prospered my way send me away that i may go to my master
and they said we will call the damsel and enquire at her mouth
and they called rebekah and said unto her wilt thou go with this man and she said i will go
and they sent away rebekah their sister and her nurse and abraham's servant and his men
and they blessed rebekah and said unto her thou art our sister be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them
and rebekah arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and followed the man and the servant took rebekah and went his way
and isaac came from the way of the well lahairoi for he dwelt in the south country
and isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming
and rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she lighted off the camel
for she had said unto the servant what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant had said it is my master therefore she took a vail and covered herself
and the servant told isaac all things that he had done
and isaac brought her into his mother sarah's tent and took rebekah and she became his wife and he loved her and isaac was comforted after his mother's death
then again abraham took a wife and her name was keturah
and she bare him zimran and jokshan and medan and midian and ishbak and shuah
and jokshan begat sheba and dedan and the sons of dedan were asshurim and letushim and leummim
and the sons of midian ephah and epher and hanoch and abidah and eldaah all these were the children of keturah
and abraham gave all that he had unto isaac
but unto the sons of the concubines which abraham had abraham gave gifts and sent them away from isaac his son while he yet lived eastward unto the east country
and these are the days of the years of abraham's life which he lived an hundred threescore and fifteen years
then abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age an old man and full of years and was gathered to his people
and his sons isaac and ishmael buried him in the cave of machpelah in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite which is before mamre
the field which abraham purchased of the sons of heth there was abraham buried and sarah his wife
and it came to pass after the death of abraham that god blessed his son isaac and isaac dwelt by the well lahairoi
now these are the generations of ishmael abraham's son whom hagar the egyptian sarah's handmaid bare unto abraham
and these are the names of the sons of ishmael by their names according to their generations the firstborn of ishmael nebajoth and kedar and adbeel and mibsam
and mishma and dumah and massa
hadar and tema jetur naphish and kedemah
these are the sons of ishmael and these are their names by their towns and by their castles twelve princes according to their nations
and these are the years of the life of ishmael an hundred and thirty and seven years and he gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his people
and they dwelt from havilah unto shur that is before egypt as thou goest toward assyria and he died in the presence of all his brethren
and these are the generations of isaac abraham's son abraham begat isaac
and isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah to wife the daughter of bethuel the syrian of padanaram the sister to laban the syrian
and isaac intreated the lord for his wife because she was barren and the lord was intreated of him and rebekah his wife conceived
and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am i thus and she went to enquire of the lord
and the lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the younger
and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb
and the first came out red all over like an hairy garment and they called his name esau
and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on esau's heel and his name was called jacob and isaac was threescore years old when she bare them
and the boys grew and esau was a cunning hunter a man of the field and jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents
and isaac loved esau because he did eat of his venison but rebekah loved jacob
and jacob sod pottage and esau came from the field and he was faint
and esau said to jacob feed me i pray thee with that same red pottage for i am faint therefore was his name called edom
and jacob said sell me this day thy birthright
and esau said behold i am at the point to die and what profit shall this birthright do to me
and jacob said swear to me this day and he sware unto him and he sold his birthright unto jacob
then jacob gave esau bread and pottage of lentiles and he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way thus esau despised his birthright
and there was a famine in the land beside the first famine that was in the days of abraham and isaac went unto abimelech king of the philistines unto gerar
and the lord appeared unto him and said go not down into egypt dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of
sojourn in this land and i will be with thee and will bless thee for unto thee and unto thy seed i will give all these countries and i will perform the oath which i sware unto abraham thy father
and i will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seed all these countries and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed
because that abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge my commandments my statutes and my laws
and isaac dwelt in gerar
and the men of the place asked him of his wife and he said she is my sister for he feared to say she is my wife lest said he the men of the place should kill me for rebekah because she was fair to look upon
and it came to pass when he had been there a long time that abimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window and saw and behold isaac was sporting with rebekah his wife
and abimelech called isaac and said behold of a surety she is thy wife and how saidst thou she is my sister and isaac said unto him because i said lest i die for her
and abimelech said what is this thou hast done unto us one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us
and abimelech charged all his people saying he that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death
then isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year an hundredfold and the lord blessed him
and the man waxed great and went forward and grew until he became very great
for he had possession of flocks and possession of herds and great store of servants and the philistines envied him
for all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of abraham his father the philistines had stopped them and filled them with earth
and abimelech said unto isaac go from us for thou art much mightier than we
and isaac departed thence and pitched his tent in the valley of gerar and dwelt there
and isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of abraham his father for the philistines had stopped them after the death of abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them
and isaac's servants digged in the valley and found there a well of springing water
and the herdmen of gerar did strive with isaac's herdmen saying the water is ours and he called the name of the well esek because they strove with him
and they digged another well and strove for that also and he called the name of it sitnah
and he removed from thence and digged another well and for that they strove not and he called the name of it rehoboth and he said for now the lord hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land
and he went up from thence to beersheba
and the lord appeared unto him the same night and said i am the god of abraham thy father fear not for i am with thee and will bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant abraham's sake
and he builded an altar there and called upon the name of the lord and pitched his tent there and there isaac's servants digged a well
then abimelech went to him from gerar and ahuzzath one of his friends and phichol the chief captain of his army
and isaac said unto them wherefore come ye to me seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from you
and they said we saw certainly that the lord was with thee and we said let there be now an oath betwixt us even betwixt us and thee and let us make a covenant with thee
that thou wilt do us no hurt as we have not touched thee and as we have done unto thee nothing but good and have sent thee away in peace thou art now the blessed of the lord
and he made them a feast and they did eat and drink
and they rose up betimes in the morning and sware one to another and isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace
and it came to pass the same day that isaac's servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged and said unto him we have found water
and he called it shebah therefore the name of the city is beersheba unto this day
and esau was forty years old when he took to wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite and bashemath the daughter of elon the hittite
which were a grief of mind unto isaac and to rebekah
and it came to pass that when isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see he called esau his eldest son and said unto him my son and he said unto him behold here am i
and he said behold now i am old i know not the day of my death
now therefore take i pray thee thy weapons thy quiver and thy bow and go out to the field and take me some venison
and make me savoury meat such as i love and bring it to me that i may eat that my soul may bless thee before i die
and rebekah heard when isaac spake to esau his son and esau went to the field to hunt for venison and to bring it
and rebekah spake unto jacob her son saying behold i heard thy father speak unto esau thy brother saying
bring me venison and make me savoury meat that i may eat and bless thee before the lord before my death
now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which i command thee
go now to the flock and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats and i will make them savoury meat for thy father such as he loveth
and thou shalt bring it to thy father that he may eat and that he may bless thee before his death
and jacob said to rebekah his mother behold esau my brother is a hairy man and i am a smooth man
my father peradventure will feel me and i shall seem to him as a deceiver and i shall bring a curse upon me and not a blessing
and his mother said unto him upon me be thy curse my son only obey my voice and go fetch me them
and he went and fetched and brought them to his mother and his mother made savoury meat such as his father loved
and rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son esau which were with her in the house and put them upon jacob her younger son
and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck
and she gave the savoury meat and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son jacob
and he came unto his father and said my father and he said here am i who art thou my son
and jacob said unto his father i am esau thy first born i have done according as thou badest me arise i pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may bless me
and isaac said unto his son how is it that thou hast found it so quickly my son and he said because the lord thy god brought it to me
and isaac said unto jacob come near i pray thee that i may feel thee my son whether thou be my very son esau or not
and jacob went near unto isaac his father and he felt him and said the voice is jacob's voice but the hands are the hands of esau
and he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as his brother esau's hands so he blessed him
and he said art thou my very son esau and he said i am
and he said bring it near to me and i will eat of my son's venison that my soul may bless thee and he brought it near to him and he did eat and he brought him wine and he drank
and his father isaac said unto him come near now and kiss me my son
and he came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the lord hath blessed
therefore god give thee of the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wine
let people serve thee and nations bow down to thee be lord over thy brethren and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee cursed be every one that curseth thee and blessed be he that blesseth thee
and it came to pass as soon as isaac had made an end of blessing jacob and jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of isaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting
and he also had made savoury meat and brought it unto his father and said unto his father let my father arise and eat of his son's venison that thy soul may bless me
and isaac his father said unto him who art thou and he said i am thy son thy firstborn esau
and isaac trembled very exceedingly and said who where is he that hath taken venison and brought it me and i have eaten of all before thou camest and have blessed him yea and he shall be blessed
and when esau heard the words of his father he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry and said unto his father bless me even me also o my father
and he said thy brother came with subtilty and hath taken away thy blessing
and he said is not he rightly named jacob for he hath supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright and behold now he hath taken away my blessing and he said hast thou not reserved a blessing for me
and isaac answered and said unto esau behold i have made him thy lord and all his brethren have i given to him for servants and with corn and wine have i sustained him and what shall i do now unto thee my son
and esau said unto his father hast thou but one blessing my father bless me even me also o my father and esau lifted up his voice and wept
and isaac his father answered and said unto him behold thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from above
and by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve thy brother and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck
and esau hated jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him and esau said in his heart the days of mourning for my father are at hand then will i slay my brother jacob
and these words of esau her elder son were told to rebekah and she sent and called jacob her younger son and said unto him behold thy brother esau as touching thee doth comfort himself purposing to kill thee
now therefore my son obey my voice and arise flee thou to laban my brother to haran
and tarry with him a few days until thy brother's fury turn away
until thy brother's anger turn away from thee and he forget that which thou hast done to him then i will send and fetch thee from thence why should i be deprived also of you both in one day
and rebekah said to isaac i am weary of my life because of the daughters of heth if jacob take a wife of the daughters of heth such as these which are of the daughters of the land what good shall my life do me
and isaac called jacob and blessed him and charged him and said unto him thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan
arise go to padanaram to the house of bethuel thy mother's father and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of laban thy mother's brother
and god almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply thee that thou mayest be a multitude of people
and give thee the blessing of abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger which god gave unto abraham
and isaac sent away jacob and he went to padanaram unto laban son of bethuel the syrian the brother of rebekah jacob's and esau's mother
when esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and sent him away to padanaram to take him a wife from thence and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge saying thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan
and that jacob obeyed his father and his mother and was gone to padanaram
and esau seeing that the daughters of canaan pleased not isaac his father
then went esau unto ishmael and took unto the wives which he had mahalath the daughter of ishmael abraham's son the sister of nebajoth to be his wife
and jacob went out from beersheba and went toward haran
and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep
and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it
and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land whereon thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed
and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed
and behold i am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to thee of
and jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not
and he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven
and jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it
and he called the name of that place bethel but the name of that city was called luz at the first
and jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on
so that i come again to my father's house in peace then shall the lord be my god
and this stone which i have set for a pillar shall be god's house and of all that thou shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee
then jacob went on his journey and came into the land of the people of the east
and he looked and behold a well in the field and lo there were three flocks of sheep lying by it for out of that well they watered the flocks and a great stone was upon the well's mouth
and thither were all the flocks gathered and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the sheep and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place
and jacob said unto them my brethren whence be ye and they said of haran are we
and he said unto them know ye laban the son of nahor and they said we know him
and he said unto them is he well and they said he is well and behold rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep
and he said lo it is yet high day neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together water ye the sheep and go and feed them
and they said we cannot until all the flocks be gathered together and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth then we water the sheep
and while he yet spake with them rachel came with her father's sheep for she kept them
and it came to pass when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban his mother's brother and the sheep of laban his mother's brother that jacob went near and rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of laban his mother's brother
and jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept
and jacob told rachel that he was her father's brother and that he was rebekah's son and she ran and told her father
and it came to pass when laban heard the tidings of jacob his sister's son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house and he told laban all these things
and laban said to him surely thou art my bone and my flesh and he abode with him the space of a month
and laban said unto jacob because thou art my brother shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought tell me what shall thy wages be
and laban had two daughters the name of the elder was leah and the name of the younger was rachel
leah was tender eyed but rachel was beautiful and well favoured
and jacob loved rachel and said i will serve thee seven years for rachel thy younger daughter
and laban said it is better that i give her to thee than that i should give her to another man abide with me
and jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her
and jacob said unto laban give me my wife for my days are fulfilled that i may go in unto her
and laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast
and it came to pass in the evening that he took leah his daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her
and laban gave unto his daughter leah zilpah his maid for an handmaid
and it came to pass that in the morning behold it was leah and he said to laban what is this thou hast done unto me did not i serve with thee for rachel wherefore then hast thou beguiled me
and laban said it must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn
fulfil her week and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years
and jacob did so and fulfilled her week and he gave him rachel his daughter to wife also
and laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her maid
and he went in also unto rachel and he loved also rachel more than leah and served with him yet seven other years
and when the lord saw that leah was hated he opened her womb but rachel was barren
and leah conceived and bare a son and she called his name reuben for she said surely the lord hath looked upon my affliction now therefore my husband will love me
and she conceived again and bare a son and said because the lord hath heard that i was hated he hath therefore given me this son also and she called his name simeon
and she conceived again and bare a son and said now this time will my husband be joined unto me because i have born him three sons therefore was his name called levi
and she conceived again and bare a son and she said now will i praise the lord therefore she called his name judah and left bearing
and when rachel saw that she bare jacob no children rachel envied her sister and said unto jacob give me children or else i die
and jacob's anger was kindled against rachel and he said am i in god's stead who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb
and she said behold my maid bilhah go in unto her and she shall bear upon my knees that i may also have children by her
and she gave him bilhah her handmaid to wife and jacob went in unto her
and bilhah conceived and bare jacob a son
and rachel said god hath judged me and hath also heard my voice and hath given me a son therefore called she his name dan
and bilhah rachel's maid conceived again and bare jacob a second son
and rachel said with great wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister and i have prevailed and she called his name naphtali
when leah saw that she had left bearing she took zilpah her maid and gave her jacob to wife
and zilpah leah's maid bare jacob a son
and leah said a troop cometh and she called his name gad
and zilpah leah's maid bare jacob a second son
and leah said happy am i for the daughters will call me blessed and she called his name asher
and reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them unto his mother leah then rachel said to leah give me i pray thee of thy son's mandrakes
and she said unto her is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also and rachel said therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes
and jacob came out of the field in the evening and leah went out to meet him and said thou must come in unto me for surely i have hired thee with my son's mandrakes and he lay with her that night
and god hearkened unto leah and she conceived and bare jacob the fifth son
and leah said god hath given me my hire because i have given my maiden to my husband and she called his name issachar
and leah conceived again and bare jacob the sixth son
and leah said god hath endued me with a good dowry now will my husband dwell with me because i have born him six sons and she called his name zebulun
and afterwards she bare a daughter and called her name dinah
and god remembered rachel and god hearkened to her and opened her womb
and she conceived and bare a son and said god hath taken away my reproach
and she called his name joseph and said the lord shall add to me another son
and it came to pass when rachel had born joseph that jacob said unto laban send me away that i may go unto mine own place and to my country
give me my wives and my children for whom i have served thee and let me go for thou knowest my service which i have done thee
and laban said unto him i pray thee if i have found favour in thine eyes tarry for i have learned by experience that the lord hath blessed me for thy sake
and he said appoint me thy wages and i will give it
and he said unto him thou knowest how i have served thee and how thy cattle was with me
for it was little which thou hadst before i came and it is now increased unto a multitude and the lord hath blessed thee since my coming and now when shall i provide for mine own house also
and he said what shall i give thee and jacob said thou shalt not give me any thing if thou wilt do this thing for me i will again feed and keep thy flock
i will pass through all thy flock to day removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle and all the brown cattle among the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats and of such shall be my hire
so shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come when it shall come for my hire before thy face every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and brown among the sheep that shall be counted stolen with me
and laban said behold i would it might be according to thy word
and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted and every one that had some white in it and all the brown among the sheep and gave them into the hand of his sons
and he set three days journey betwixt himself and jacob and jacob fed the rest of laban's flocks
and jacob took him rods of green poplar and of the hazel and chestnut tree and pilled white strakes in them and made the white appear which was in the rods
and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink that they should conceive when they came to drink
and the flocks conceived before the rods and brought forth cattle ringstraked speckled and spotted
and jacob did separate the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked and all the brown in the flock of laban and he put his own flocks by themselves and put them not unto laban's cattle
and it came to pass whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters that they might conceive among the rods
but when the cattle were feeble he put them not in so the feebler were laban's and the stronger jacob's
and the man increased exceedingly and had much cattle and maidservants and menservants and camels and asses
and he heard the words of laban's sons saying jacob hath taken away all that was our father's and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory
and jacob beheld the countenance of laban and behold it was not toward him as before
and the lord said unto jacob return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred and i will be with thee
and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his flock
and said unto them i see your father's countenance that it is not toward me as before but the god of my father hath been with me
and ye know that with all my power i have served your father
and your father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten times but god suffered him not to hurt me
if he said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all the cattle bare speckled and if he said thus the ringstraked shall be thy hire then bare all the cattle ringstraked
thus god hath taken away the cattle of your father and given them to me
and it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived that i lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream and behold the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked speckled and grisled
and the angel of god spake unto me in a dream saying jacob and i said here am i
and he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked speckled and grisled for i have seen all that laban doeth unto thee
i am the god of bethel where thou anointedst the pillar and where thou vowedst a vow unto me now arise get thee out from this land and return unto the land of thy kindred
and rachel and leah answered and said unto him is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house
are we not counted of him strangers for he hath sold us and hath quite devoured also our money
for all the riches which god hath taken from our father that is ours and our children's now then whatsoever god hath said unto thee do
then jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon camels
and he carried away all his cattle and all his goods which he had gotten the cattle of his getting which he had gotten in padanaram for to go to isaac his father in the land of canaan
and laban went to shear his sheep and rachel had stolen the images that were her father's
and jacob stole away unawares to laban the syrian in that he told him not that he fled
so he fled with all that he had and he rose up and passed over the river and set his face toward the mount gilead
and it was told laban on the third day that jacob was fled
and he took his brethren with him and pursued after him seven days journey and they overtook him in the mount gilead
and god came to laban the syrian in a dream by night and said unto him take heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad
then laban overtook jacob now jacob had pitched his tent in the mount and laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of gilead
and laban said to jacob what hast thou done that thou hast stolen away unawares to me and carried away my daughters as captives taken with the sword
wherefore didst thou flee away secretly and steal away from me and didst not tell me that i might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs with tabret and with harp
and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters thou hast now done foolishly in so doing
it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt but the god of your father spake unto me yesternight saying take thou heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad
and now though thou wouldest needs be gone because thou sore longedst after thy father's house yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods
and jacob answered and said to laban because i was afraid for i said peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me
with whomsoever thou findest thy gods let him not live before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me and take it to thee for jacob knew not that rachel had stolen them
and laban went into jacob's tent and into leah's tent and into the two maidservants tents but he found them not then went he out of leah's tent and entered into rachel's tent
now rachel had taken the images and put them in the camel's furniture and sat upon them and laban searched all the tent but found them not
and she said to her father let it not displease my lord that i cannot rise up before thee for the custom of women is upon me and he searched but found not the images
and jacob was wroth and chode with laban and jacob answered and said to laban what is my trespass what is my sin that thou hast so hotly pursued after me
whereas thou hast searched all my stuff what hast thou found of all thy household stuff set it here before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge betwixt us both
this twenty years have i been with thee thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young and the rams of thy flock have i not eaten
that which was torn of beasts i brought not unto thee i bare the loss of it of my hand didst thou require it whether stolen by day or stolen by night
thus i was in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep departed from mine eyes
thus have i been twenty years in thy house i served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy cattle and thou hast changed my wages ten times
except the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had been with me surely thou hadst sent me away now empty god hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands and rebuked thee yesternight
and laban answered and said unto jacob these daughters are my daughters and these children are my children and these cattle are my cattle and all that thou seest is mine and what can i do this day unto these my daughters or unto their children which they have born
now therefore come thou let us make a covenant i and thou and let it be for a witness between me and thee
and jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar
and jacob said unto his brethren gather stones and they took stones and made an heap and they did eat there upon the heap
and laban called it jegarsahadutha but jacob called it galeed
and laban said this heap is a witness between me and thee this day therefore was the name of it called galeed
and mizpah for he said the lord watch between me and thee when we are absent one from another
if thou shalt afflict my daughters or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters no man is with us see god is witness betwixt me and thee
and laban said to jacob behold this heap and behold this pillar which i have cast betwixt me and thee
this heap be witness and this pillar be witness that i will not pass over this heap to thee and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me for harm
the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their father judge betwixt us and jacob sware by the fear of his father isaac
then jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount and called his brethren to eat bread and they did eat bread and tarried all night in the mount
and early in the morning laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them and laban departed and returned unto his place
and jacob went on his way and the angels of god met him
and when jacob saw them he said this is god's host and he called the name of that place mahanaim
and jacob sent messengers before him to esau his brother unto the land of seir the country of edom
and he commanded them saying thus shall ye speak unto my lord esau thy servant jacob saith thus i have sojourned with laban and stayed there until now
and i have oxen and asses flocks and menservants and womenservants and i have sent to tell my lord that i may find grace in thy sight
and the messengers returned to jacob saying we came to thy brother esau and also he cometh to meet thee and four hundred men with him
then jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided the people that was with him and the flocks and herds and the camels into two bands
and said if esau come to the one company and smite it then the other company which is left shall escape
and jacob said o god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac the lord which saidst unto me return unto thy country and to thy kindred and i will deal well with thee
i am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hast shewed unto thy servant for with my staff i passed over this jordan and now i am become two bands
deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children
and thou saidst i will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude
and he lodged there that same night and took of that which came to his hand a present for esau his brother
two hundred she goats and twenty he goats two hundred ewes and twenty rams
thirty milch camels with their colts forty kine and ten bulls twenty she asses and ten foals
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants every drove by themselves and said unto his servants pass over before me and put a space betwixt drove and drove
and he commanded the foremost saying when esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee saying whose art thou and whither goest thou and whose are these before thee
then thou shalt say they be thy servant jacob's it is a present sent unto my lord esau and behold also he is behind us
and so commanded he the second and the third and all that followed the droves saying on this manner shall ye speak unto esau when ye find him
and say ye moreover behold thy servant jacob is behind us for he said i will appease him with the present that goeth before me and afterward i will see his face peradventure he will accept of me
so went the present over before him and himself lodged that night in the company
and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two womenservants and his eleven sons and passed over the ford jabbok
and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had
and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him
and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me
and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob
and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince hast thou power with god and with men and hast prevailed
and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name and he blessed him there
and jacob called the name of the place peniel for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved
and as he passed over penuel the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh
therefore the children of israel eat not of the sinew which shrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day because he touched the hollow of jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank
and jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold esau came and with him four hundred men and he divided the children unto leah and unto rachel and unto the two handmaids
and he put the handmaids and their children foremost and leah and her children after and rachel and joseph hindermost
and he passed over before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother
and esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him and they wept
and he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said who are those with thee and he said the children which god hath graciously given thy servant
then the handmaidens came near they and their children and they bowed themselves
and leah also with her children came near and bowed themselves and after came joseph near and rachel and they bowed themselves
and he said what meanest thou by all this drove which i met and he said these are to find grace in the sight of my lord
and esau said i have enough my brother keep that thou hast unto thyself
and jacob said nay i pray thee if now i have found grace in thy sight then receive my present at my hand for therefore i have seen thy face as though i had seen the face of god and thou wast pleased with me
take i pray thee my blessing that is brought to thee because god hath dealt graciously with me and because i have enough and he urged him and he took it
and he said let us take our journey and let us go and i will go before thee
and he said unto him my lord knoweth that the children are tender and the flocks and herds with young are with me and if men should overdrive them one day all the flock will die
let my lord i pray thee pass over before his servant and i will lead on softly according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure until i come unto my lord unto seir
and esau said let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me and he said what needeth it let me find grace in the sight of my lord
so esau returned that day on his way unto seir
and jacob journeyed to succoth and built him an house and made booths for his cattle therefore the name of the place is called succoth
and jacob came to shalem a city of shechem which is in the land of canaan when he came from padanaram and pitched his tent before the city
and he bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his tent at the hand of the children of hamor shechem's father for an hundred pieces of money
and he erected there an altar and called it eleloheisrael
and dinah the daughter of leah which she bare unto jacob went out to see the daughters of the land
and when shechem the son of hamor the hivite prince of the country saw her he took her and lay with her and defiled her
and his soul clave unto dinah the daughter of jacob and he loved the damsel and spake kindly unto the damsel
and shechem spake unto his father hamor saying get me this damsel to wife
and jacob heard that he had defiled dinah his daughter now his sons were with his cattle in the field and jacob held his peace until they were come
and hamor the father of shechem went out unto jacob to commune with him
and the sons of jacob came out of the field when they heard it and the men were grieved and they were very wroth because he had wrought folly in israel in lying with jacob's daughter which thing ought not to be done
and hamor communed with them saying the soul of my son shechem longeth for your daughter i pray you give her him to wife
and make ye marriages with us and give your daughters unto us and take our daughters unto you
and ye shall dwell with us and the land shall be before you dwell and trade ye therein and get you possessions therein
and shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren let me find grace in your eyes and what ye shall say unto me i will give
ask me never so much dowry and gift and i will give according as ye shall say unto me but give me the damsel to wife
and the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father deceitfully and said because he had defiled dinah their sister
and they said unto them we cannot do this thing to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised for that were a reproach unto us
but in this will we consent unto you if ye will be as we be that every male of you be circumcised
then will we give our daughters unto you and we will take your daughters to us and we will dwell with you and we will become one people
but if ye will not hearken unto us to be circumcised then will we take our daughter and we will be gone
and their words pleased hamor and shechem hamor's son
and the young man deferred not to do the thing because he had delight in jacob's daughter and he was more honourable than all the house of his father
and hamor and shechem his son came unto the gate of their city and communed with the men of their city saying
these men are peaceable with us therefore let them dwell in the land and trade therein for the land behold it is large enough for them let us take their daughters to us for wives and let us give them our daughters
only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us to be one people if every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised
shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours only let us consent unto them and they will dwell with us
and unto hamor and unto shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city and every male was circumcised all that went out of the gate of his city
and it came to pass on the third day when they were sore that two of the sons of jacob simeon and levi dinah's brethren took each man his sword and came upon the city boldly and slew all the males
and they slew hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the sword and took dinah out of shechem's house and went out
the sons of jacob came upon the slain and spoiled the city because they had defiled their sister
they took their sheep and their oxen and their asses and that which was in the city and that which was in the field
and all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives took they captive and spoiled even all that was in the house
and jacob said to simeon and levi ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land among the canaanites and the perizzites and i being few in number they shall gather themselves together against me and slay me and i shall be destroyed i and my house
and they said should he deal with our sister as with an harlot
and god said unto jacob arise go up to bethel and dwell there and make there an altar unto god that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of esau thy brother
then jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and change your garments
and let us arise and go up to bethel and i will make there an altar unto god who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which i went
and they gave unto jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand and all their earrings which were in their ears and jacob hid them under the oak which was by shechem
and they journeyed and the terror of god was upon the cities that were round about them and they did not pursue after the sons of jacob
so jacob came to luz which is in the land of canaan that is bethel he and all the people that were with him
and he built there an altar and called the place elbethel because there god appeared unto him when he fled from the face of his brother
but deborah rebekah's nurse died and she was buried beneath bethel under an oak and the name of it was called allonbachuth
and god appeared unto jacob again when he came out of padanaram and blessed him
and god said unto him thy name is jacob thy name shall not be called any more jacob but israel shall be thy name and he called his name israel
and god said unto him i am god almighty be fruitful and multiply a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee and kings shall come out of thy loins
and the land which i gave abraham and isaac to thee i will give it and to thy seed after thee will i give the land
and god went up from him in the place where he talked with him
and jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him even a pillar of stone and he poured a drink offering thereon and he poured oil thereon
and jacob called the name of the place where god spake with him bethel
and they journeyed from bethel and there was but a little way to come to ephrath and rachel travailed and she had hard labour
and it came to pass when she was in hard labour that the midwife said unto her fear not thou shalt have this son also
and it came to pass as her soul was in departing for she died that she called his name benoni but his father called him benjamin
and rachel died and was buried in the way to ephrath which is bethlehem
and jacob set a pillar upon her grave that is the pillar of rachel's grave unto this day
and israel journeyed and spread his tent beyond the tower of edar
and it came to pass when israel dwelt in that land that reuben went and lay with bilhah his father's concubine and israel heard it now the sons of jacob were twelve
the sons of leah reuben jacob's firstborn and simeon and levi and judah and issachar and zebulun
the sons of rachel joseph and benjamin
and the sons of bilhah rachel's handmaid dan and naphtali
and the sons of zilpah leah's handmaid gad and asher these are the sons of jacob which were born to him in padanaram
and jacob came unto isaac his father unto mamre unto the city of arbah which is hebron where abraham and isaac sojourned
and the days of isaac were an hundred and fourscore years
and isaac gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his people being old and full of days and his sons esau and jacob buried him
now these are the generations of esau who is edom
esau took his wives of the daughters of canaan adah the daughter of elon the hittite and aholibamah the daughter of anah the daughter of zibeon the hivite

and adah bare to esau eliphaz and bashemath bare reuel

and esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all the persons of his house and his cattle and all his beasts and all his substance which he had got in the land of canaan and went into the country from the face of his brother jacob
for their riches were more than that they might dwell together and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle

and jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of canaan
these are the generations of jacob joseph being seventeen years old was feeding the flock with his brethren and the lad was with the sons of bilhah and with the sons of zilpah his father's wives and joseph brought unto his father their evil report
now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colours
and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him
and joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his brethren and they hated him yet the more
and he said unto them hear i pray you this dream which i have dreamed
for behold we were binding sheaves in the field and lo my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves stood round about and made obeisance to my sheaf
and his brethren said to him shalt thou indeed reign over us or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words
and he dreamed yet another dream and told it his brethren and said behold i have dreamed a dream more and behold the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me
and he told it to his father and to his brethren and his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou hast dreamed shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth
and his brethren envied him but his father observed the saying
and his brethren went to feed their father's flock in shechem
and israel said unto joseph do not thy brethren feed the flock in shechem come and i will send thee unto them and he said to him here am i
and he said to him go i pray thee see whether it be well with thy brethren and well with the flocks and bring me word again so he sent him out of the vale of hebron and he came to shechem
and a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in the field and the man asked him saying what seekest thou
and he said i seek my brethren tell me i pray thee where they feed their flocks
and the man said they are departed hence for i heard them say let us go to dothan and joseph went after his brethren and found them in dothan
and when they saw him afar off even before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay him
and they said one to another behold this dreamer cometh
come now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into some pit and we will say some evil beast hath devoured him and we shall see what will become of his dreams
and reuben heard it and he delivered him out of their hands and said let us not kill him
and reuben said unto them shed no blood but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he might rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again
and it came to pass when joseph was come unto his brethren that they stript joseph out of his coat his coat of many colours that was on him
and they took him and cast him into a pit and the pit was empty there was no water in it
and they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a company of ishmeelites came from gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh going to carry it down to egypt
and judah said unto his brethren what profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood
come and let us sell him to the ishmeelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his brethren were content
then there passed by midianites merchantmen and they drew and lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver and they brought joseph into egypt
and reuben returned unto the pit and behold joseph was not in the pit and he rent his clothes
and he returned unto his brethren and said the child is not and i whither shall i go
and they took joseph's coat and killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in the blood
and they sent the coat of many colours and they brought it to their father and said this have we found know now whether it be thy son's coat or no
and he knew it and said it is my son's coat an evil beast hath devoured him joseph is without doubt rent in pieces
and jacob rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his loins and mourned for his son many days
and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted and he said for i will go down into the grave unto my son mourning thus his father wept for him
and the midianites sold him into egypt unto potiphar an officer of pharaoh's and captain of the guard
and it came to pass at that time that judah went down from his brethren and turned in to a certain adullamite whose name was hirah
and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name was shuah and he took her and went in unto her
and she conceived and bare a son and he called his name er
and she conceived again and bare a son and she called his name onan
and she yet again conceived and bare a son and called his name shelah and he was at chezib when she bare him
and judah took a wife for er his firstborn whose name was tamar
and er judah's firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord and the lord slew him
and judah said unto onan go in unto thy brother's wife and marry her and raise up seed to thy brother
and onan knew that the seed should not be his and it came to pass when he went in unto his brother's wife that he spilled it on the ground lest that he should give seed to his brother
and the thing which he did displeased the lord wherefore he slew him also
then said judah to tamar his daughter in law remain a widow at thy father's house till shelah my son be grown for he said lest peradventure he die also as his brethren did and tamar went and dwelt in her father's house
and in process of time the daughter of shuah judah's wife died and judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepshearers to timnath he and his friend hirah the adullamite
and it was told tamar saying behold thy father in law goeth up to timnath to shear his sheep
and she put her widow's garments off from her and covered her with a vail and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is by the way to timnath for she saw that shelah was grown and she was not given unto him to wife
when judah saw her he thought her to be an harlot because she had covered her face
and he turned unto her by the way and said go to i pray thee let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter in law and she said what wilt thou give me that thou mayest come in unto me
and he said i will send thee a kid from the flock and she said wilt thou give me a pledge till thou send it
and he said what pledge shall i give thee and she said thy signet and thy bracelets and thy staff that is in thine hand and he gave it her and came in unto her and she conceived by him
and she arose and went away and laid by her vail from her and put on the garments of her widowhood
and judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the adullamite to receive his pledge from the woman's hand but he found her not
then he asked the men of that place saying where is the harlot that was openly by the way side and they said there was no harlot in this place
and he returned to judah and said i cannot find her and also the men of the place said that there was no harlot in this place
and judah said let her take it to her lest we be shamed behold i sent this kid and thou hast not found her
and it came to pass about three months after that it was told judah saying tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot and also behold she is with child by whoredom and judah said bring her forth and let her be burnt
when she was brought forth she sent to her father in law saying by the man whose these are am i with child and she said discern i pray thee whose are these the signet and bracelets and staff
and judah acknowledged them and said she hath been more righteous than i because that i gave her not to shelah my son and he knew her again no more
and it came to pass in the time of her travail that behold twins were in her womb
and it came to pass when she travailed that the one put out his hand and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread saying this came out first
and it came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold his brother came out and she said how hast thou broken forth this breach be upon thee therefore his name was called pharez
and afterward came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand and his name was called zarah
and joseph was brought down to egypt and potiphar an officer of pharaoh captain of the guard an egyptian bought him of the hands of the ishmeelites which had brought him down thither
and the lord was with joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the egyptian
and his master saw that the lord was with him and that the lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand
and joseph found grace in his sight and he served him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his hand
and it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house and over all that he had that the lord blessed the egyptian's house for joseph's sake and the blessing of the lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field
and he left all that he had in joseph's hand and he knew not ought he had save the bread which he did eat and joseph was a goodly person and well favoured
and it came to pass after these things that his master's wife cast her eyes upon joseph and she said lie with me
but he refused and said unto his master's wife behold my master wotteth not what is with me in the house and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand
there is none greater in this house than i neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee because thou art his wife how then can i do this great wickedness and sin against god
and it came to pass as she spake to joseph day by day that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with her
and it came to pass about this time that joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there within
and she caught him by his garment saying lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out
and it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and was fled forth
that she called unto the men of her house and spake unto them saying see he hath brought in an hebrew unto us to mock us he came in unto me to lie with me and i cried with a loud voice
and it came to pass when he heard that i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled and got him out
and she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home
and she spake unto him according to these words saying the hebrew servant which thou hast brought unto us came in unto me to mock me
and it came to pass as i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled out
and it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife which she spake unto him saying after this manner did thy servant to me that his wrath was kindled
and joseph's master took him and put him into the prison a place where the king's prisoners were bound and he was there in the prison
but the lord was with joseph and shewed him mercy and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison
and the keeper of the prison committed to joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it
the keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand because the lord was with him and that which he did the lord made it to prosper
and it came to pass after these things that the butler of the king of egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of egypt
and pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers against the chief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakers
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard into the prison the place where joseph was bound
and the captain of the guard charged joseph with them and he served them and they continued a season in ward
and they dreamed a dream both of them each man his dream in one night each man according to the interpretation of his dream the butler and the baker of the king of egypt which were bound in the prison
and joseph came in unto them in the morning and looked upon them and behold they were sad
and he asked pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house saying wherefore look ye so sadly to day
and they said unto him we have dreamed a dream and there is no interpreter of it and joseph said unto them do not interpretations belong to god tell me them i pray you
and the chief butler told his dream to joseph and said to him in my dream behold a vine was before me
and in the vine were three branches and it was as though it budded and her blossoms shot forth and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes
and pharaoh's cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and pressed them into pharaoh's cup and i gave the cup into pharaoh's hand
and joseph said unto him this is the interpretation of it the three branches are three days
yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place and thou shalt deliver pharaoh's cup into his hand after the former manner when thou wast his butler
but think on me when it shall be well with thee and shew kindness i pray thee unto me and make mention of me unto pharaoh and bring me out of this house
for indeed i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrews and here also have i done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon
when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he said unto joseph i also was in my dream and behold i had three white baskets on my head
and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for pharaoh and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head
and joseph answered and said this is the interpretation thereof the three baskets are three days
yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee and shall hang thee on a tree and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee
and it came to pass the third day which was pharaoh's birthday that he made a feast unto all his servants and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants
and he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again and he gave the cup into pharaoh's hand
but he hanged the chief baker as joseph had interpreted to them
yet did not the chief butler remember joseph but forgat him
and it came to pass at the end of two full years that pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river
and behold there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed and they fed in a meadow
and behold seven other kine came up after them out of the river ill favoured and leanfleshed and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river
and the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine so pharaoh awoke
and he slept and dreamed the second time and behold seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk rank and good
and behold seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them
and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears and pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled and he sent and called for all the magicians of egypt and all the wise men thereof and pharaoh told them his dream but there was none that could interpret them unto pharaoh
then spake the chief butler unto pharaoh saying i do remember my faults this day
pharaoh was wroth with his servants and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house both me and the chief baker
and we dreamed a dream in one night i and he we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream
and there was there with us a young man an hebrew servant to the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpret
and it came to pass as he interpreted to us so it was me he restored unto mine office and him he hanged
then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his raiment and came in unto pharaoh
and pharaoh said unto joseph i have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it and i have heard say of thee that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it
and joseph answered pharaoh saying it is not in me god shall give pharaoh an answer of peace
and pharaoh said unto joseph in my dream behold i stood upon the bank of the river
and behold there came up out of the river seven kine fatfleshed and well favoured and they fed in a meadow
and behold seven other kine came up after them poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed such as i never saw in all the land of egypt for badness
and the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine
and when they had eaten them up it could not be known that they had eaten them but they were still ill favoured as at the beginning so i awoke
and i saw in my dream and behold seven ears came up in one stalk full and good
and behold seven ears withered thin and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them
and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears and i told this unto the magicians but there was none that could declare it to me
and joseph said unto pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one god hath shewed pharaoh what he is about to do
the seven good kine are seven years and the seven good ears are seven years the dream is one
and the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine
this is the thing which i have spoken unto pharaoh what god is about to do he sheweth unto pharaoh
behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt
and there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt and the famine shall consume the land
and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following for it shall be very grievous
and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh twice it is because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it to pass
now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of egypt
let pharaoh do this and let him appoint officers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenteous years
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of egypt that the land perish not through the famine
and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants
and pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this is a man in whom the spirit of god is
and pharaoh said unto joseph forasmuch as god hath shewed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as thou art
thou shalt be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will i be greater than thou
and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over all the land of egypt
and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon joseph's hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck
and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of egypt
and pharaoh said unto joseph i am pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of egypt
and pharaoh called joseph's name zaphnathpaaneah and he gave him to wife asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on and joseph went out over all the land of egypt
and joseph was thirty years old when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt and joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land of egypt
and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls
and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was round about every city laid he up in the same
and joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much until he left numbering for it was without number
and unto joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare unto him
and joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh for god said he hath made me forget all my toil and all my father's house
and the name of the second called he ephraim for god hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction
and the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of egypt were ended
and the seven years of dearth began to come according as joseph had said and the dearth was in all lands but in all the land of egypt there was bread
and when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried to pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said unto all the egyptians go unto joseph what he saith to you do
and the famine was over all the face of the earth and joseph opened all the storehouses and sold unto the egyptians and the famine waxed sore in the land of egypt
and all countries came into egypt to joseph for to buy corn because that the famine was so sore in all lands
now when jacob saw that there was corn in egypt jacob said unto his sons why do ye look one upon another
and he said behold i have heard that there is corn in egypt get you down thither and buy for us from thence that we may live and not die
and joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in egypt
but benjamin joseph's brother jacob sent not with his brethren for he said lest peradventure mischief befall him
and the sons of israel came to buy corn among those that came for the famine was in the land of canaan
and joseph was the governor over the land and he it was that sold to all the people of the land and joseph's brethren came and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth
and joseph saw his brethren and he knew them but made himself strange unto them and spake roughly unto them and he said unto them whence come ye and they said from the land of canaan to buy food
and joseph knew his brethren but they knew not him
and joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them and said unto them ye are spies to see the nakedness of the land ye are come
and they said unto him nay my lord but to buy food are thy servants come
we are all one man's sons we are true men thy servants are no spies
and he said unto them nay but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come
and they said thy servants are twelve brethren the sons of one man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is not
and joseph said unto them that is it that i spake unto you saying ye are spies
hereby ye shall be proved by the life of pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence except your youngest brother come hither
send one of you and let him fetch your brother and ye shall be kept in prison that your words may be proved whether there be any truth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely ye are spies
and he put them all together into ward three days
and joseph said unto them the third day this do and live for i fear god
if ye be true men let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison go ye carry corn for the famine of your houses
but bring your youngest brother unto me so shall your words be verified and ye shall not die and they did so
and they said one to another we are verily guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us
and reuben answered them saying spake i not unto you saying do not sin against the child and ye would not hear therefore behold also his blood is required
and they knew not that joseph understood them for he spake unto them by an interpreter
and he turned himself about from them and wept and returned to them again and communed with them and took from them simeon and bound him before their eyes
then joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn and to restore every man's money into his sack and to give them provision for the way and thus did he unto them
and they laded their asses with the corn and departed thence
and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn he espied his money for behold it was in his sack's mouth
and he said unto his brethren my money is restored and lo it is even in my sack and their heart failed them and they were afraid saying one to another what is this that god hath done unto us
and they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan and told him all that befell unto them saying
the man who is the lord of the land spake roughly to us and took us for spies of the country
and we said unto him we are true men we are no spies
we be twelve brethren sons of our father one is not and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan
and the man the lord of the country said unto us hereby shall i know that ye are true men leave one of your brethren here with me and take food for the famine of your households and be gone
and bring your youngest brother unto me then shall i know that ye are no spies but that ye are true men so will i deliver you your brother and ye shall traffick in the land
and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that behold every man's bundle of money was in his sack and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money they were afraid
and jacob their father said unto them me have ye bereaved of my children joseph is not and simeon is not and ye will take benjamin away all these things are against me
and reuben spake unto his father saying slay my two sons if i bring him not to thee deliver him into my hand and i will bring him to thee again
and he said my son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he is left alone if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave
and the famine was sore in the land
and it came to pass when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of egypt their father said unto them go again buy us a little food
and judah spake unto him saying the man did solemnly protest unto us saying ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you
if thou wilt send our brother with us we will go down and buy thee food
but if thou wilt not send him we will not go down for the man said unto us ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you
and israel said wherefore dealt ye so ill with me as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother
and they said the man asked us straitly of our state and of our kindred saying is your father yet alive have ye another brother and we told him according to the tenor of these words could we certainly know that he would say bring your brother down
and judah said unto israel his father send the lad with me and we will arise and go that we may live and not die both we and thou and also our little ones
i will be surety for him of my hand shalt thou require him if i bring him not unto thee and set him before thee then let me bear the blame for ever
for except we had lingered surely now we had returned this second time
and their father israel said unto them if it must be so now do this take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels and carry down the man a present a little balm and a little honey spices and myrrh nuts and almonds
and take double money in your hand and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks carry it again in your hand peradventure it was an oversight
take also your brother and arise go again unto the man
and god almighty give you mercy before the man that he may send away your other brother and benjamin if i be bereaved of my children i am bereaved
and the men took that present and they took double money in their hand and benjamin and rose up and went down to egypt and stood before joseph
and when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the ruler of his house bring these men home and slay and make ready for these men shall dine with me at noon
and the man did as joseph bade and the man brought the men into joseph's house
and the men were afraid because they were brought into joseph's house and they said because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us and take us for bondmen and our asses
and they came near to the steward of joseph's house and they communed with him at the door of the house
and said o sir we came indeed down at the first time to buy food
and it came to pass when we came to the inn that we opened our sacks and behold every man's money was in the mouth of his sack our money in full weight and we have brought it again in our hand
and other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks
and he said peace be to you fear not your god and the god of your father hath given you treasure in your sacks i had your money and he brought simeon out unto them
and the man brought the men into joseph's house and gave them water and they washed their feet and he gave their asses provender
and they made ready the present against joseph came at noon for they heard that they should eat bread there
and when joseph came home they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed themselves to him to the earth
and he asked them of their welfare and said is your father well the old man of whom ye spake is he yet alive
and they answered thy servant our father is in good health he is yet alive and they bowed down their heads and made obeisance
and he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother benjamin his mother's son and said is this your younger brother of whom ye spake unto me and he said god be gracious unto thee my son
and joseph made haste for his bowels did yearn upon his brother and he sought where to weep and he entered into his chamber and wept there
and he washed his face and went out and refrained himself and said set on bread
and they set on for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the egyptians which did eat with him by themselves because the egyptians might not eat bread with the hebrews for that is an abomination unto the egyptians
and they sat before him the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth and the men marvelled one at another
and he took and sent messes unto them from before him but benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs and they drank and were merry with him
and he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the men's sacks with food as much as they can carry and put every man's money in his sack's mouth
and put my cup the silver cup in the sack's mouth of the youngest and his corn money and he did according to the word that joseph had spoken
as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they and their asses
and when they were gone out of the city and not yet far off joseph said unto his steward up follow after the men and when thou dost overtake them say unto them wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good
is not this it in which my lord drinketh and whereby indeed he divineth ye have done evil in so doing
and he overtook them and he spake unto them these same words
and they said unto him wherefore saith my lord these words god forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing
behold the money which we found in our sacks mouths we brought again unto thee out of the land of canaan how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold
with whomsoever of thy servants it be found both let him die and we also will be my lord's bondmen
and he said now also let it be according unto your words he with whom it is found shall be my servant and ye shall be blameless
then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground and opened every man his sack
and he searched and began at the eldest and left at the youngest and the cup was found in benjamin's sack
then they rent their clothes and laded every man his ass and returned to the city
and judah and his brethren came to joseph's house for he was yet there and they fell before him on the ground
and joseph said unto them what deed is this that ye have done wot ye not that such a man as i can certainly divine
and judah said what shall we say unto my lord what shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves god hath found out the iniquity of thy servants behold we are my lord's servants both we and he also with whom the cup is found
and he said god forbid that i should do so but the man in whose hand the cup is found he shall be my servant and as for you get you up in peace unto your father
then judah came near unto him and said oh my lord let thy servant i pray thee speak a word in my lord's ears and let not thine anger burn against thy servant for thou art even as pharaoh
my lord asked his servants saying have ye a father or a brother
and we said unto my lord we have a father an old man and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loveth him
and thou saidst unto thy servants bring him down unto me that i may set mine eyes upon him
and we said unto my lord the lad cannot leave his father for if he should leave his father his father would die
and thou saidst unto thy servants except your youngest brother come down with you ye shall see my face no more
and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father we told him the words of my lord
and our father said go again and buy us a little food
and we said we cannot go down if our youngest brother be with us then will we go down for we may not see the man's face except our youngest brother be with us
and thy servant my father said unto us ye know that my wife bare me two sons
and the one went out from me and i said surely he is torn in pieces and i saw him not since
and if ye take this also from me and mischief befall him ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave
now therefore when i come to thy servant my father and the lad be not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life
it shall come to pass when he seeth that the lad is not with us that he will die and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave
for thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father saying if i bring him not unto thee then i shall bear the blame to my father for ever
now therefore i pray thee let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord and let the lad go up with his brethren
for how shall i go up to my father and the lad be not with me lest peradventure i see the evil that shall come on my father
then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried cause every man to go out from me and there stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his brethren
and he wept aloud and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh heard
and joseph said unto his brethren i am joseph doth my father yet live and his brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence
and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray you and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom ye sold into egypt
now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life
for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest
and god sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance
so now it was not you that sent me hither but god and he hath made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
haste ye and go up to my father and say unto him thus saith thy son joseph god hath made me lord of all egypt come down unto me tarry not
and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy children's children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast
and there will i nourish thee for yet there are five years of famine lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast come to poverty
and behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you
and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt and of all that ye have seen and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither
and he fell upon his brother benjamin's neck and wept and benjamin wept upon his neck
moreover he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them and after that his brethren talked with him
and the fame thereof was heard in pharaoh's house saying joseph's brethren are come and it pleased pharaoh well and his servants
and pharaoh said unto joseph say unto thy brethren this do ye lade your beasts and go get you unto the land of canaan
and take your father and your households and come unto me and i will give you the good of the land of egypt and ye shall eat the fat of the land
now thou art commanded this do ye take you wagons out of the land of egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come
also regard not your stuff for the good of all the land of egypt is yours
and the children of israel did so and joseph gave them wagons according to the commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision for the way
to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment but to benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of raiment
and to his father he sent after this manner ten asses laden with the good things of egypt and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way
so he sent his brethren away and they departed and he said unto them see that ye fall not out by the way
and they went up out of egypt and came into the land of canaan unto jacob their father
and told him saying joseph is yet alive and he is governor over all the land of egypt and jacob's heart fainted for he believed them not
and they told him all the words of joseph which he had said unto them and when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of jacob their father revived
and israel said it is enough joseph my son is yet alive i will go and see him before i die
and israel took his journey with all that he had and came to beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father isaac
and god spake unto israel in the visions of the night and said jacob jacob and he said here am i
and he said i am god the god of thy father fear not to go down into egypt for i will there make of thee a great nation
i will go down with thee into egypt and i will also surely bring thee up again and joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes
and jacob rose up from beersheba and the sons of israel carried jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which pharaoh had sent to carry him
and they took their cattle and their goods which they had gotten in the land of canaan and came into egypt jacob and all his seed with him
his sons and his sons sons with him his daughters and his sons daughters and all his seed brought he with him into egypt
and these are the names of the children of israel which came into egypt jacob and his sons reuben jacob's firstborn
and the sons of reuben hanoch and phallu and hezron and carmi

and the sons of joseph which were born him in egypt were two souls all the souls of the house of jacob which came into egypt were threescore and ten
and he sent judah before him unto joseph to direct his face unto goshen and they came into the land of goshen
and joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet israel his father to goshen and presented himself unto him and he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while
and israel said unto joseph now let me die since i have seen thy face because thou art yet alive
and joseph said unto his brethren and unto his father's house i will go up and shew pharaoh and say unto him my brethren and my father's house which were in the land of canaan are come unto me
and the men are shepherds for their trade hath been to feed cattle and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have
and it shall come to pass when pharaoh shall call you and shall say what is your occupation
that ye shall say thy servants trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now both we and also our fathers that ye may dwell in the land of goshen for every shepherd is an abomination unto the egyptians
then joseph came and told pharaoh and said my father and my brethren and their flocks and their herds and all that they have are come out of the land of canaan and behold they are in the land of goshen
and he took some of his brethren even five men and presented them unto pharaoh
and pharaoh said unto his brethren what is your occupation and they said unto pharaoh thy servants are shepherds both we and also our fathers
they said moreover unto pharaoh for to sojourn in the land are we come for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks for the famine is sore in the land of canaan now therefore we pray thee let thy servants dwell in the land of goshen
and pharaoh spake unto joseph saying thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee
the land of egypt is before thee in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell in the land of goshen let them dwell and if thou knowest any men of activity among them then make them rulers over my cattle
and joseph brought in jacob his father and set him before pharaoh and jacob blessed pharaoh
and pharaoh said unto jacob how old art thou
and jacob said unto pharaoh the days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years few and evil have the days of the years of my life been and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage
and jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from before pharaoh
and joseph placed his father and his brethren and gave them a possession in the land of egypt in the best of the land in the land of rameses as pharaoh had commanded
and joseph nourished his father and his brethren and all his father's household with bread according to their families
and there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very sore so that the land of egypt and all the land of canaan fainted by reason of the famine
and joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan for the corn which they bought and joseph brought the money into pharaoh's house
and when money failed in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan all the egyptians came unto joseph and said give us bread for why should we die in thy presence for the money faileth
and joseph said give your cattle and i will give you for your cattle if money fail
and they brought their cattle unto joseph and joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses and for the flocks and for the cattle of the herds and for the asses and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year
when that year was ended they came unto him the second year and said unto him we will not hide it from my lord how that our money is spent my lord also hath our herds of cattle there is not ought left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands
wherefore shall we die before thine eyes both we and our land buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be servants unto pharaoh and give us seed that we may live and not die that the land be not desolate
and joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh for the egyptians sold every man his field because the famine prevailed over them so the land became pharaoh's
and as for the people he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of egypt even to the other end thereof
only the land of the priests bought he not for the priests had a portion assigned them of pharaoh and did eat their portion which pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their lands
then joseph said unto the people behold i have bought you this day and your land for pharaoh lo here is seed for you and ye shall sow the land
and it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall give the fifth part unto pharaoh and four parts shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for them of your households and for food for your little ones
and they said thou hast saved our lives let us find grace in the sight of my lord and we will be pharaoh's servants
and joseph made it a law over the land of egypt unto this day that pharaoh should have the fifth part except the land of the priests only which became not pharaoh's
and israel dwelt in the land of egypt in the country of goshen and they had possessions therein and grew and multiplied exceedingly
and jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years so the whole age of jacob was an hundred forty and seven years
and the time drew nigh that israel must die and he called his son joseph and said unto him if now i have found grace in thy sight put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me bury me not i pray thee in egypt
but i will lie with my fathers and thou shalt carry me out of egypt and bury me in their buryingplace and he said i will do as thou hast said
and he said swear unto me and he sware unto him and israel bowed himself upon the bed's head
and it came to pass after these things that one told joseph behold thy father is sick and he took with him his two sons manasseh and ephraim
and one told jacob and said behold thy son joseph cometh unto thee and israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed
and jacob said unto joseph god almighty appeared unto me at luz in the land of canaan and blessed me
and said unto me behold i will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and i will make of thee a multitude of people and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession
and now thy two sons ephraim and manasseh which were born unto thee in the land of egypt before i came unto thee into egypt are mine as reuben and simeon they shall be mine
and thy issue which thou begettest after them shall be thine and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance
and as for me when i came from padan rachel died by me in the land of canaan in the way when yet there was but a little way to come unto ephrath and i buried her there in the way of ephrath the same is bethlehem
and israel beheld joseph's sons and said who are these
and joseph said unto his father they are my sons whom god hath given me in this place and he said bring them i pray thee unto me and i will bless them
now the eyes of israel were dim for age so that he could not see and he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced them
and israel said unto joseph i had not thought to see thy face and lo god hath shewed me also thy seed
and joseph brought them out from between his knees and he bowed himself with his face to the earth
and joseph took them both ephraim in his right hand toward israel's left hand and manasseh in his left hand toward israel's right hand and brought them near unto him
and israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon ephraim's head who was the younger and his left hand upon manasseh's head guiding his hands wittingly for manasseh was the firstborn
and he blessed joseph and said god before whom my fathers abraham and isaac did walk the god which fed me all my life long unto this day
the angel which redeemed me from all evil bless the lads and let my name be named on them and the name of my fathers abraham and isaac and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth
and when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of ephraim it displeased him and he held up his father's hand to remove it from ephraim's head unto manasseh's head
and joseph said unto his father not so my father for this is the firstborn put thy right hand upon his head
and his father refused and said i know it my son i know it he also shall become a people and he also shall be great but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of nations
and he blessed them that day saying in thee shall israel bless saying god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh and he set ephraim before manasseh
and israel said unto joseph behold i die but god shall be with you and bring you again unto the land of your fathers
moreover i have given to thee one portion above thy brethren which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow
and jacob called unto his sons and said gather yourselves together that i may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days
gather yourselves together and hear ye sons of jacob and hearken unto israel your father
reuben thou art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power
unstable as water thou shalt not excel because thou wentest up to thy father's bed then defiledst thou it he went up to my couch
simeon and levi are brethren instruments of cruelty are in their habitations
o my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assembly mine honour be not thou united for in their anger they slew a man and in their selfwill they digged down a wall
cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel
judah thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee
judah is a lion's whelp from the prey my son thou art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall rouse him up
the sceptre shall not depart from judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall the gathering of the people be
binding his foal unto the vine and his ass's colt unto the choice vine he washed his garments in wine and his clothes in the blood of grapes
his eyes shall be red with wine and his teeth white with milk
zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea and he shall be for an haven of ships and his border shall be unto zidon
issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens
and he saw that rest was good and the land that it was pleasant and bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant unto tribute
dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of israel
dan shall be a serpent by the way an adder in the path that biteth the horse heels so that his rider shall fall backward
i have waited for thy salvation o lord
gad a troop shall overcome him but he shall overcome at the last
out of asher his bread shall be fat and he shall yield royal dainties
naphtali is a hind let loose he giveth goodly words
joseph is a fruitful bough even a fruitful bough by a well whose branches run over the wall
the archers have sorely grieved him and shot at him and hated him
but his bow abode in strength and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty god of jacob from thence is the shepherd the stone of israel
even by the god of thy father who shall help thee and by the almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above blessings of the deep that lieth under blessings of the breasts and of the womb
the blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills they shall be on the head of joseph and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren
benjamin shall ravin as a wolf in the morning he shall devour the prey and at night he shall divide the spoil
all these are the twelve tribes of israel and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them every one according to his blessing he blessed them
and he charged them and said unto them i am to be gathered unto my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of ephron the hittite
in the cave that is in the field of machpelah which is before mamre in the land of canaan which abraham bought with the field of ephron the hittite for a possession of a buryingplace
there they buried abraham and sarah his wife there they buried isaac and rebekah his wife and there i buried leah
the purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of heth
and when jacob had made an end of commanding his sons he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost and was gathered unto his people
and joseph fell upon his father's face and wept upon him and kissed him
and joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father and the physicians embalmed israel
and forty days were fulfilled for him for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed and the egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days
and when the days of his mourning were past joseph spake unto the house of pharaoh saying if now i have found grace in your eyes speak i pray you in the ears of pharaoh saying
my father made me swear saying lo i die in my grave which i have digged for me in the land of canaan there shalt thou bury me now therefore let me go up i pray thee and bury my father and i will come again
and pharaoh said go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear
and joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all the servants of pharaoh the elders of his house and all the elders of the land of egypt
and all the house of joseph and his brethren and his father's house only their little ones and their flocks and their herds they left in the land of goshen
and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen and it was a very great company
and they came to the threshingfloor of atad which is beyond jordan and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation and he made a mourning for his father seven days
and when the inhabitants of the land the canaanites saw the mourning in the floor of atad they said this is a grievous mourning to the egyptians wherefore the name of it was called abelmizraim which is beyond jordan
and his sons did unto him according as he commanded them
for his sons carried him into the land of canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of machpelah which abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of ephron the hittite before mamre
and joseph returned into egypt he and his brethren and all that went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his father
and when joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead they said joseph will peradventure hate us and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him
and they sent a messenger unto joseph saying thy father did command before he died saying
so shall ye say unto joseph forgive i pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren and their sin for they did unto thee evil and now we pray thee forgive the trespass of the servants of the god of thy father and joseph wept when they spake unto him
and his brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we be thy servants
and joseph said unto them fear not for am i in the place of god
but as for you ye thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive
now therefore fear ye not i will nourish you and your little ones and he comforted them and spake kindly unto them
and joseph dwelt in egypt he and his father's house and joseph lived an hundred and ten years
and joseph saw ephraim's children of the third generation the children also of machir the son of manasseh were brought up upon joseph's knees
and joseph said unto his brethren i die and god will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to abraham to isaac and to jacob
and joseph took an oath of the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones from hence
so joseph died being an hundred and ten years old and they embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in egypt
now these are the names of the children of israel which came into egypt every man and his household came with jacob
reuben simeon levi and judah
issachar zebulun and benjamin
dan and naphtali gad and asher
and all the souls that came out of the loins of jacob were seventy souls for joseph was in egypt already
and joseph died and all his brethren and all that generation
and the children of israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding mighty and the land was filled with them
now there arose up a new king over egypt which knew not joseph
and he said unto his people behold the people of the children of israel are more and mightier than we
come on let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when there falleth out any war they join also unto our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the land
therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens and they built for pharaoh treasure cities pithom and raamses
but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew and they were grieved because of the children of israel
and the egyptians made the children of israel to serve with rigour
and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage in morter and in brick and in all manner of service in the field all their service wherein they made them serve was with rigour
and the king of egypt spake to the hebrew midwives of which the name of the one was shiphrah and the name of the other puah
and he said when ye do the office of a midwife to the hebrew women and see them upon the stools if it be a son then ye shall kill him but if it be a daughter then she shall live
but the midwives feared god and did not as the king of egypt commanded them but saved the men children alive
and the king of egypt called for the midwives and said unto them why have ye done this thing and have saved the men children alive
and the midwives said unto pharaoh because the hebrew women are not as the egyptian women for they are lively and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them
therefore god dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty
and it came to pass because the midwives feared god that he made them houses
and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son that is born ye shall cast into the river and every daughter ye shall save alive
and there went a man of the house of levi and took to wife a daughter of levi
and the woman conceived and bare a son and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hid him three months
and when she could not longer hide him she took for him an ark of bulrushes and daubed it with slime and with pitch and put the child therein and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink
and his sister stood afar off to wit what would be done to him
and the daughter of pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river and her maidens walked along by the river's side and when she saw the ark among the flags she sent her maid to fetch it
and when she had opened it she saw the child and behold the babe wept and she had compassion on him and said this is one of the hebrews children
then said his sister to pharaoh's daughter shall i go and call to thee a nurse of the hebrew women that she may nurse the child for thee
and pharaoh's daughter said to her go and the maid went and called the child's mother
and pharaoh's daughter said unto her take this child away and nurse it for me and i will give thee thy wages and the woman took the child and nursed it
and the child grew and she brought him unto pharaoh's daughter and he became her son and she called his name moses and she said because i drew him out of the water
and it came to pass in those days when moses was grown that he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied an egyptian smiting an hebrew one of his brethren
and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there was no man he slew the egyptian and hid him in the sand
and when he went out the second day behold two men of the hebrews strove together and he said to him that did the wrong wherefore smitest thou thy fellow
and he said who made thee a prince and a judge over us intendest thou to kill me as thou killedst the egyptian and moses feared and said surely this thing is known
now when pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay moses but moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of midian and he sat down by a well
now the priest of midian had seven daughters and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock
and the shepherds came and drove them away but moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock
and when they came to reuel their father he said how is it that ye are come so soon to day
and they said an egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and also drew water enough for us and watered the flock
and he said unto his daughters and where is he why is it that ye have left the man call him that he may eat bread
and moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave moses zipporah his daughter
and she bare him a son and he called his name gershom for he said i have been a stranger in a strange land
and it came to pass in process of time that the king of egypt died and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage
and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob
and god looked upon the children of israel and god had respect unto them
now moses kept the flock of jethro his father in law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb
and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed
and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt
and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i
and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground
moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god
and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for i know their sorrows
and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites
now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel is come unto me and i have also seen the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppress them
come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt
and moses said unto god who am i that i should go unto pharaoh and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt
and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that i have sent thee when thou hast brought forth the people out of egypt ye shall serve god upon this mountain
and moses said unto god behold when i come unto the children of israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them
and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me unto you
and god said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name for ever and this is my memorial unto all generations
go and gather the elders of israel together and say unto them the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham of isaac and of jacob appeared unto me saying i have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in egypt
and i have said i will bring you up out of the affliction of egypt unto the land of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey
and they shall hearken to thy voice and thou shalt come thou and the elders of israel unto the king of egypt and ye shall say unto him the lord god of the hebrews hath met with us and now let us go we beseech thee three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the lord our god
and i am sure that the king of egypt will not let you go no not by a mighty hand
and i will stretch out my hand and smite egypt with all my wonders which i will do in the midst thereof and after that he will let you go
and i will give this people favour in the sight of the egyptians and it shall come to pass that when ye go ye shall not go empty
but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour and of her that sojourneth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters and ye shall spoil the egyptians
and moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the lord hath not appeared unto thee
and the lord said unto him what is that in thine hand and he said a rod
and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and moses fled from before it
and the lord said unto moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand
that they may believe that the lord god of their fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath appeared unto thee
and the lord said furthermore unto him put now thine hand into thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous as snow
and he said put thine hand into thy bosom again and he put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom and behold it was turned again as his other flesh
and it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign
and it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these two signs neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land
and moses said unto the lord o my lord i am not eloquent neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant but i am slow of speech and of a slow tongue
and the lord said unto him who hath made man's mouth or who maketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind have not i the lord
now therefore go and i will be with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say
and he said o my lord send i pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt send
and the anger of the lord was kindled against moses and he said is not aaron the levite thy brother i know that he can speak well and also behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart
and thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth and i will be with thy mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what ye shall do
and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and he shall be even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth and thou shalt be to him instead of god
and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand wherewith thou shalt do signs
and moses went and returned to jethro his father in law and said unto him let me go i pray thee and return unto my brethren which are in egypt and see whether they be yet alive and jethro said to moses go in peace
and the lord said unto moses in midian go return into egypt for all the men are dead which sought thy life
and moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of egypt and moses took the rod of god in his hand
and the lord said unto moses when thou goest to return into egypt see that thou do all those wonders before pharaoh which i have put in thine hand but i will harden his heart that he shall not let the people go
and thou shalt say unto pharaoh thus saith the lord israel is my son even my firstborn
and i say unto thee let my son go that he may serve me and if thou refuse to let him go behold i will slay thy son even thy firstborn
and it came to pass by the way in the inn that the lord met him and sought to kill him
then zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his feet and said surely a bloody husband art thou to me
so he let him go then she said a bloody husband thou art because of the circumcision
and the lord said to aaron go into the wilderness to meet moses and he went and met him in the mount of god and kissed him
and moses told aaron all the words of the lord who had sent him and all the signs which he had commanded him
and moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of israel
and aaron spake all the words which the lord had spoken unto moses and did the signs in the sight of the people
and the people believed and when they heard that the lord had visited the children of israel and that he had looked upon their affliction then they bowed their heads and worshipped
and afterward moses and aaron went in and told pharaoh thus saith the lord god of israel let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness
and pharaoh said who is the lord that i should obey his voice to let israel go i know not the lord neither will i let israel go
and they said the god of the hebrews hath met with us let us go we pray thee three days journey into the desert and sacrifice unto the lord our god lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword
and the king of egypt said unto them wherefore do ye moses and aaron let the people from their works get you unto your burdens
and pharaoh said behold the people of the land now are many and ye make them rest from their burdens
and pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people and their officers saying
ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick as heretofore let them go and gather straw for themselves
and the tale of the bricks which they did make heretofore ye shall lay upon them ye shall not diminish ought thereof for they be idle therefore they cry saying let us go and sacrifice to our god
let there more work be laid upon the men that they may labour therein and let them not regard vain words
and the taskmasters of the people went out and their officers and they spake to the people saying thus saith pharaoh i will not give you straw
go ye get you straw where ye can find it yet not ought of your work shall be diminished
so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of egypt to gather stubble instead of straw
and the taskmasters hasted them saying fulfil your works your daily tasks as when there was straw
and the officers of the children of israel which pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them were beaten and demanded wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day as heretofore
then the officers of the children of israel came and cried unto pharaoh saying wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants
there is no straw given unto thy servants and they say to us make brick and behold thy servants are beaten but the fault is in thine own people
but he said ye are idle ye are idle therefore ye say let us go and do sacrifice to the lord
go therefore now and work for there shall no straw be given you yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks
and the officers of the children of israel did see that they were in evil case after it was said ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task
and they met moses and aaron who stood in the way as they came forth from pharaoh
and they said unto them the lord look upon you and judge because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in their hand to slay us
and moses returned unto the lord and said lord wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people why is it that thou hast sent me
for since i came to pharaoh to speak in thy name he hath done evil to this people neither hast thou delivered thy people at all
then the lord said unto moses now shalt thou see what i will do to pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land
and god spake unto moses and said unto him i am the lord
and i appeared unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob by the name of god almighty but by my name jehovah was i not known to them
and i have also established my covenant with them to give them the land of canaan the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were strangers
and i have also heard the groaning of the children of israel whom the egyptians keep in bondage and i have remembered my covenant
wherefore say unto the children of israel i am the lord and i will bring you out from under the burdens of the egyptians and i will rid you out of their bondage and i will redeem you with a stretched out arm and with great judgments
and i will take you to me for a people and i will be to you a god and ye shall know that i am the lord your god which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the egyptians
and i will bring you in unto the land concerning the which i did swear to give it to abraham to isaac and to jacob and i will give it you for an heritage i am the lord
and moses spake so unto the children of israel but they hearkened not unto moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage
and the lord spake unto moses saying
go in speak unto pharaoh king of egypt that he let the children of israel go out of his land
and moses spake before the lord saying behold the children of israel have not hearkened unto me how then shall pharaoh hear me who am of uncircumcised lips
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron and gave them a charge unto the children of israel and unto pharaoh king of egypt to bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt
these be the heads of their fathers houses the sons of reuben the firstborn of israel hanoch and pallu hezron and carmi these be the families of reuben
and the sons of simeon jemuel and jamin and ohad and jachin and zohar and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman these are the families of simeon
and these are the names of the sons of levi according to their generations gershon and kohath and merari and the years of the life of levi were an hundred thirty and seven years
the sons of gershon libni and shimi according to their families
and the sons of kohath amram and izhar and hebron and uzziel and the years of the life of kohath were an hundred thirty and three years
and the sons of merari mahali and mushi these are the families of levi according to their generations
and amram took him jochebed his father's sister to wife and she bare him aaron and moses and the years of the life of amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years
and the sons of izhar korah and nepheg and zichri
and the sons of uzziel mishael and elzaphan and zithri
and aaron took him elisheba daughter of amminadab sister of naashon to wife and she bare him nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar
and the sons of korah assir and elkanah and abiasaph these are the families of the korhites
and eleazar aaron's son took him one of the daughters of putiel to wife and she bare him phinehas these are the heads of the fathers of the levites according to their families
these are that aaron and moses to whom the lord said bring out the children of israel from the land of egypt according to their armies
these are they which spake to pharaoh king of egypt to bring out the children of israel from egypt these are that moses and aaron
and it came to pass on the day when the lord spake unto moses in the land of egypt
that the lord spake unto moses saying i am the lord speak thou unto pharaoh king of egypt all that i say unto thee
and moses said before the lord behold i am of uncircumcised lips and how shall pharaoh hearken unto me
and the lord said unto moses see i have made thee a god to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet
thou shalt speak all that i command thee and aaron thy brother shall speak unto pharaoh that he send the children of israel out of his land
and i will harden pharaoh's heart and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of egypt
but pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that i may lay my hand upon egypt and bring forth mine armies and my people the children of israel out of the land of egypt by great judgments
and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i stretch forth mine hand upon egypt and bring out the children of israel from among them
and moses and aaron did as the lord commanded them so did they
and moses was fourscore years old and aaron fourscore and three years old when they spake unto pharaoh
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying
when pharaoh shall speak unto you saying shew a miracle for you then thou shalt say unto aaron take thy rod and cast it before pharaoh and it shall become a serpent
and moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh and they did so as the lord had commanded and aaron cast down his rod before pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent
then pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers now the magicians of egypt they also did in like manner with their enchantments
for they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents but aaron's rod swallowed up their rods
and he hardened pharaoh's heart that he hearkened not unto them as the lord had said
and the lord said unto moses pharaoh's heart is hardened he refuseth to let the people go
get thee unto pharaoh in the morning lo he goeth out unto the water and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand
and thou shalt say unto him the lord god of the hebrews hath sent me unto thee saying let my people go that they may serve me in the wilderness and behold hitherto thou wouldest not hear
thus saith the lord in this thou shalt know that i am the lord behold i will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river and they shall be turned to blood
and the fish that is in the river shall die and the river shall stink and the egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river
and the lord spake unto moses say unto aaron take thy rod and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of egypt upon their streams upon their rivers and upon their ponds and upon all their pools of water that they may become blood and that there may be blood throughout all the land of egypt both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone
and moses and aaron did so as the lord commanded and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river in the sight of pharaoh and in the sight of his servants and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood
and the fish that was in the river died and the river stank and the egyptians could not drink of the water of the river and there was blood throughout all the land of egypt
and the magicians of egypt did so with their enchantments and pharaoh's heart was hardened neither did he hearken unto them as the lord had said
and pharaoh turned and went into his house neither did he set his heart to this also
and all the egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink for they could not drink of the water of the river
and seven days were fulfilled after that the lord had smitten the river
and the lord spake unto moses go unto pharaoh and say unto him thus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me
and if thou refuse to let them go behold i will smite all thy borders with frogs
and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up and come into thine house and into thy bedchamber and upon thy bed and into the house of thy servants and upon thy people and into thine ovens and into thy kneadingtroughs
and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servants
and the lord spake unto moses say unto aaron stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams over the rivers and over the ponds and cause frogs to come up upon the land of egypt
and aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt and the frogs came up and covered the land of egypt
and the magicians did so with their enchantments and brought up frogs upon the land of egypt
then pharaoh called for moses and aaron and said intreat the lord that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people and i will let the people go that they may do sacrifice unto the lord
and moses said unto pharaoh glory over me when shall i intreat for thee and for thy servants and for thy people to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses that they may remain in the river only
and he said to morrow and he said be it according to thy word that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the lord our god
and the frogs shall depart from thee and from thy houses and from thy servants and from thy people they shall remain in the river only
and moses and aaron went out from pharaoh and moses cried unto the lord because of the frogs which he had brought against pharaoh
and the lord did according to the word of moses and the frogs died out of the houses out of the villages and out of the fields
and they gathered them together upon heaps and the land stank
but when pharaoh saw that there was respite he hardened his heart and hearkened not unto them as the lord had said
and the lord said unto moses say unto aaron stretch out thy rod and smite the dust of the land that it may become lice throughout all the land of egypt
and they did so for aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smote the dust of the earth and it became lice in man and in beast all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of egypt
and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice but they could not so there were lice upon man and upon beast
then the magicians said unto pharaoh this is the finger of god and pharaoh's heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as the lord had said
and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning and stand before pharaoh lo he cometh forth to the water and say unto him thus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me
else if thou wilt not let my people go behold i will send swarms of flies upon thee and upon thy servants and upon thy people and into thy houses and the houses of the egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies and also the ground whereon they are
and i will sever in that day the land of goshen in which my people dwell that no swarms of flies shall be there to the end thou mayest know that i am the lord in the midst of the earth
and i will put a division between my people and thy people to morrow shall this sign be
and the lord did so and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of pharaoh and into his servants houses and into all the land of egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies
and pharaoh called for moses and for aaron and said go ye sacrifice to your god in the land
and moses said it is not meet so to do for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians to the lord our god lo shall we sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians before their eyes and will they not stone us
we will go three days journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the lord our god as he shall command us
and pharaoh said i will let you go that ye may sacrifice to the lord your god in the wilderness only ye shall not go very far away intreat for me
and moses said behold i go out from thee and i will intreat the lord that the swarms of flies may depart from pharaoh from his servants and from his people to morrow but let not pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the lord
and moses went out from pharaoh and intreated the lord
and the lord did according to the word of moses and he removed the swarms of flies from pharaoh from his servants and from his people there remained not one
and pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also neither would he let the people go
then the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh and tell him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me
for if thou refuse to let them go and wilt hold them still
behold the hand of the lord is upon thy cattle which is in the field upon the horses upon the asses upon the camels upon the oxen and upon the sheep there shall be a very grievous murrain
and the lord shall sever between the cattle of israel and the cattle of egypt and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of israel
and the lord appointed a set time saying to morrow the lord shall do this thing in the land
and the lord did that thing on the morrow and all the cattle of egypt died but of the cattle of the children of israel died not one
and pharaoh sent and behold there was not one of the cattle of the israelites dead and the heart of pharaoh was hardened and he did not let the people go
and the lord said unto moses and unto aaron take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace and let moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of pharaoh
and it shall become small dust in all the land of egypt and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast throughout all the land of egypt
and they took ashes of the furnace and stood before pharaoh and moses sprinkled it up toward heaven and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast
and the magicians could not stand before moses because of the boils for the boil was upon the magicians and upon all the egyptians
and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh and he hearkened not unto them as the lord had spoken unto moses
and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning and stand before pharaoh and say unto him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me
for i will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart and upon thy servants and upon thy people that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth
for now i will stretch out my hand that i may smite thee and thy people with pestilence and thou shalt be cut off from the earth
and in very deed for this cause have i raised thee up for to shew in thee my power and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth
as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people that thou wilt not let them go
behold to morrow about this time i will cause it to rain a very grievous hail such as hath not been in egypt since the foundation thereof even until now
send therefore now and gather thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field and shall not be brought home the hail shall come down upon them and they shall die
he that feared the word of the lord among the servants of pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses
and he that regarded not the word of the lord left his servants and his cattle in the field
and the lord said unto moses stretch forth thine hand toward heaven that there may be hail in all the land of egypt upon man and upon beast and upon every herb of the field throughout the land of egypt
and moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven and the lord sent thunder and hail and the fire ran along upon the ground and the lord rained hail upon the land of egypt
so there was hail and fire mingled with the hail very grievous such as there was none like it in all the land of egypt since it became a nation
and the hail smote throughout all the land of egypt all that was in the field both man and beast and the hail smote every herb of the field and brake every tree of the field
only in the land of goshen where the children of israel were was there no hail
and pharaoh sent and called for moses and aaron and said unto them i have sinned this time the lord is righteous and i and my people are wicked
intreat the lord for it is enough that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail and i will let you go and ye shall stay no longer
and moses said unto him as soon as i am gone out of the city i will spread abroad my hands unto the lord and the thunder shall cease neither shall there be any more hail that thou mayest know how that the earth is the lord's
but as for thee and thy servants i know that ye will not yet fear the lord god
and the flax and the barley was smitten for the barley was in the ear and the flax was bolled
but the wheat and the rie were not smitten for they were not grown up
and moses went out of the city from pharaoh and spread abroad his hands unto the lord and the thunders and hail ceased and the rain was not poured upon the earth
and when pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased he sinned yet more and hardened his heart he and his servants
and the heart of pharaoh was hardened neither would he let the children of israel go as the lord had spoken by moses
and the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh for i have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants that i might shew these my signs before him
and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son and of thy son's son what things i have wrought in egypt and my signs which i have done among them that ye may know how that i am the lord
and moses and aaron came in unto pharaoh and said unto him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews how long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me let my people go that they may serve me
else if thou refuse to let my people go behold to morrow will i bring the locusts into thy coast
and they shall cover the face of the earth that one cannot be able to see the earth and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped which remaineth unto you from the hail and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field
and they shall fill thy houses and the houses of all thy servants and the houses of all the egyptians which neither thy fathers nor thy fathers fathers have seen since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day and he turned himself and went out from pharaoh
and pharaoh's servants said unto him how long shall this man be a snare unto us let the men go that they may serve the lord their god knowest thou not yet that egypt is destroyed
and moses and aaron were brought again unto pharaoh and he said unto them go serve the lord your god but who are they that shall go
and moses said we will go with our young and with our old with our sons and with our daughters with our flocks and with our herds will we go for we must hold a feast unto the lord
and he said unto them let the lord be so with you as i will let you go and your little ones look to it for evil is before you
not so go now ye that are men and serve the lord for that ye did desire and they were driven out from pharaoh's presence
and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand over the land of egypt for the locusts that they may come up upon the land of egypt and eat every herb of the land even all that the hail hath left
and moses stretched forth his rod over the land of egypt and the lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night and when it was morning the east wind brought the locusts
and the locusts went up over all the land of egypt and rested in all the coasts of egypt very grievous were they before them there were no such locusts as they neither after them shall be such
for they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land was darkened and they did eat every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left and there remained not any green thing in the trees or in the herbs of the field through all the land of egypt
then pharaoh called for moses and aaron in haste and he said i have sinned against the lord your god and against you
now therefore forgive i pray thee my sin only this once and intreat the lord your god that he may take away from me this death only
and he went out from pharaoh and intreated the lord
and the lord turned a mighty strong west wind which took away the locusts and cast them into the red sea there remained not one locust in all the coasts of egypt
but the lord hardened pharaoh's heart so that he would not let the children of israel go
and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand toward heaven that there may be darkness over the land of egypt even darkness which may be felt
and moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven and there was a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days
they saw not one another neither rose any from his place for three days but all the children of israel had light in their dwellings
and pharaoh called unto moses and said go ye serve the lord only let your flocks and your herds be stayed let your little ones also go with you
and moses said thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may sacrifice unto the lord our god
our cattle also shall go with us there shall not an hoof be left behind for thereof must we take to serve the lord our god and we know not with what we must serve the lord until we come thither
but the lord hardened pharaoh's heart and he would not let them go
and pharaoh said unto him get thee from me take heed to thyself see my face no more for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die
and moses said thou hast spoken well i will see thy face again no more
and the lord said unto moses yet will i bring one plague more upon pharaoh and upon egypt afterwards he will let you go hence when he shall let you go he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether
speak now in the ears of the people and let every man borrow of his neighbour and every woman of her neighbour jewels of silver and jewels of gold
and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the egyptians moreover the man moses was very great in the land of egypt in the sight of pharaoh's servants and in the sight of the people
and moses said thus saith the lord about midnight will i go out into the midst of egypt
and all the firstborn in the land of egypt shall die from the first born of pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill and all the firstborn of beasts
and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egypt such as there was none like it nor shall be like it any more
but against any of the children of israel shall not a dog move his tongue against man or beast that ye may know how that the lord doth put a difference between the egyptians and israel
and all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bow down themselves unto me saying get thee out and all the people that follow thee and after that i will go out and he went out from pharaoh in a great anger
and the lord said unto moses pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of egypt
and moses and aaron did all these wonders before pharaoh and the lord hardened pharaoh's heart so that he would not let the children of israel go out of his land
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying
this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you
speak ye unto all the congregation of israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for an house
and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb
your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats
and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening
and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it
and they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it
eat not of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the purtenance thereof
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire
and thus shall ye eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is the lord's passover
for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord
and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt
and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and ye shall keep it a feast to the lord throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever
seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day that soul shall be cut off from israel
and in the first day there shall be an holy convocation and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you no manner of work shall be done in them save that which every man must eat that only may be done of you
and ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread for in this selfsame day have i brought your armies out of the land of egypt therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever
in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at even ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the month at even
seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses for whosoever eateth that which is leavened even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of israel whether he be a stranger or born in the land
ye shall eat nothing leavened in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread
then moses called for all the elders of israel and said unto them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the passover
and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the bason and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning
for the lord will pass through to smite the egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two side posts the lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you
and ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever
and it shall come to pass when ye be come to the land which the lord will give you according as he hath promised that ye shall keep this service
and it shall come to pass when your children shall say unto you what mean ye by this service
that ye shall say it is the sacrifice of the lord's passover who passed over the houses of the children of israel in egypt when he smote the egyptians and delivered our houses and the people bowed the head and worshipped
and the children of israel went away and did as the lord had commanded moses and aaron so did they
and it came to pass that at midnight the lord smote all the firstborn in the land of egypt from the firstborn of pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon and all the firstborn of cattle
and pharaoh rose up in the night he and all his servants and all the egyptians and there was a great cry in egypt for there was not a house where there was not one dead
and he called for moses and aaron by night and said rise up and get you forth from among my people both ye and the children of israel and go serve the lord as ye have said
also take your flocks and your herds as ye have said and be gone and bless me also
and the egyptians were urgent upon the people that they might send them out of the land in haste for they said we be all dead men
and the people took their dough before it was leavened their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders
and the children of israel did according to the word of moses and they borrowed of the egyptians jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment
and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the egyptians so that they lent unto them such things as they required and they spoiled the egyptians
and the children of israel journeyed from rameses to succoth about six hundred thousand on foot that were men beside children
and a mixed multitude went up also with them and flocks and herds even very much cattle
and they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of egypt for it was not leavened because they were thrust out of egypt and could not tarry neither had they prepared for themselves any victual
now the sojourning of the children of israel who dwelt in egypt was four hundred and thirty years
and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years even the selfsame day it came to pass that all the hosts of the lord went out from the land of egypt
it is a night to be much observed unto the lord for bringing them out from the land of egypt this is that night of the lord to be observed of all the children of israel in their generations
and the lord said unto moses and aaron this is the ordinance of the passover there shall no stranger eat thereof
but every man's servant that is bought for money when thou hast circumcised him then shall he eat thereof
a foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof
in one house shall it be eaten thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house neither shall ye break a bone thereof
all the congregation of israel shall keep it
and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the passover to the lord let all his males be circumcised and then let him come near and keep it and he shall be as one that is born in the land for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof
one law shall be to him that is homeborn and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you
thus did all the children of israel as the lord commanded moses and aaron so did they
and it came to pass the selfsame day that the lord did bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their armies
and the lord spake unto moses saying
sanctify unto me all the firstborn whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of israel both of man and of beast it is mine
and moses said unto the people remember this day in which ye came out from egypt out of the house of bondage for by strength of hand the lord brought you out from this place there shall no leavened bread be eaten
this day came ye out in the month abib
and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the hivites and the jebusites which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee a land flowing with milk and honey that thou shalt keep this service in this month
seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the lord
unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters
and thou shalt shew thy son in that day saying this is done because of that which the lord did unto me when i came forth out of egypt
and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand and for a memorial between thine eyes that the lord's law may be in thy mouth for with a strong hand hath the lord brought thee out of egypt
thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year
and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers and shall give it thee
that thou shalt set apart unto the lord all that openeth the matrix and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast the males shall be the lord's
and every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt break his neck and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem
and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what is this that thou shalt say unto him by strength of hand the lord brought us out from egypt from the house of bondage
and it came to pass when pharaoh would hardly let us go that the lord slew all the firstborn in the land of egypt both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast therefore i sacrifice to the lord all that openeth the matrix being males but all the firstborn of my children i redeem
and it shall be for a token upon thine hand and for frontlets between thine eyes for by strength of hand the lord brought us forth out of egypt
and it came to pass when pharaoh had let the people go that god led them not through the way of the land of the philistines although that was near for god said lest peradventure the people repent when they see war and they return to egypt
but god led the people about through the way of the wilderness of the red sea and the children of israel went up harnessed out of the land of egypt
and moses took the bones of joseph with him for he had straitly sworn the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you
and they took their journey from succoth and encamped in etham in the edge of the wilderness
and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night
he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel that they turn and encamp before pihahiroth between migdol and the sea over against baalzephon before it shall ye encamp by the sea
for pharaoh will say of the children of israel they are entangled in the land the wilderness hath shut them in
and i will harden pharaoh's heart that he shall follow after them and i will be honoured upon pharaoh and upon all his host that the egyptians may know that i am the lord and they did so
and it was told the king of egypt that the people fled and the heart of pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people and they said why have we done this that we have let israel go from serving us
and he made ready his chariot and took his people with him
and he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the chariots of egypt and captains over every one of them
and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of egypt and he pursued after the children of israel and the children of israel went out with an high hand
but the egyptians pursued after them all the horses and chariots of pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook them encamping by the sea beside pihahiroth before baalzephon
and when pharaoh drew nigh the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord
and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of egypt
is not this the word that we did tell thee in egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness
and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will shew to you to day for the egyptians whom ye have seen to day ye shall see them again no more for ever
the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace
and the lord said unto moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward
but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea
and i behold i will harden the hearts of the egyptians and they shall follow them and i will get me honour upon pharaoh and upon all his host upon his chariots and upon his horsemen
and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i have gotten me honour upon pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his horsemen
and the angel of god which went before the camp of israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them
and it came between the camp of the egyptians and the camp of israel and it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that the one came not near the other all the night
and moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided
and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left
and the egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midst of the sea even all pharaoh's horses his chariots and his horsemen
and it came to pass that in the morning watch the lord looked unto the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud and troubled the host of the egyptians
and took off their chariot wheels that they drave them heavily so that the egyptians said let us flee from the face of israel for the lord fighteth for them against the egyptians
and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand over the sea that the waters may come again upon the egyptians upon their chariots and upon their horsemen
and moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared and the egyptians fled against it and the lord overthrew the egyptians in the midst of the sea
and the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the host of pharaoh that came into the sea after them there remained not so much as one of them
but the children of israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left
thus the lord saved israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the sea shore
and israel saw that great work which the lord did upon the egyptians and the people feared the lord and believed the lord and his servant moses
then sang moses and the children of israel this song unto the lord and spake saying i will sing unto the lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea
the lord is my strength and song and he is become my salvation he is my god and i will prepare him an habitation my father's god and i will exalt him
the lord is a man of war the lord is his name
pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea his chosen captains also are drowned in the red sea
the depths have covered them they sank into the bottom as a stone
thy right hand o lord is become glorious in power thy right hand o lord hath dashed in pieces the enemy
and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee thou sentest forth thy wrath which consumed them as stubble
and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together the floods stood upright as an heap and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea
the enemy said i will pursue i will overtake i will divide the spoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them i will draw my sword my hand shall destroy them
thou didst blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank as lead in the mighty waters
who is like unto thee o lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders
thou stretchedst out thy right hand the earth swallowed them
thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation
the people shall hear and be afraid sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of palestina
then the dukes of edom shall be amazed the mighty men of moab trembling shall take hold upon them all the inhabitants of canaan shall melt away
fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone till thy people pass over o lord till the people pass over which thou hast purchased
thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance in the place o lord which thou hast made for thee to dwell in in the sanctuary o lord which thy hands have established
the lord shall reign for ever and ever
for the horse of pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea and the lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them but the children of israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea
and miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances
and miriam answered them sing ye to the lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea
so moses brought israel from the red sea and they went out into the wilderness of shur and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water
and when they came to marah they could not drink of the waters of marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called marah
and the people murmured against moses saying what shall we drink
and he cried unto the lord and the lord shewed him a tree which when he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he proved them
and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the lord thy god and wilt do that which is right in his sight and wilt give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes i will put none of these diseases upon thee which i have brought upon the egyptians for i am the lord that healeth thee
and they came to elim where were twelve wells of water and threescore and ten palm trees and they encamped there by the waters
and they took their journey from elim and all the congregation of the children of israel came unto the wilderness of sin which is between elim and sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of egypt
and the whole congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and aaron in the wilderness
and the children of israel said unto them would to god we had died by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt when we sat by the flesh pots and when we did eat bread to the full for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger
then said the lord unto moses behold i will rain bread from heaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day that i may prove them whether they will walk in my law or no
and it shall come to pass that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily
and moses and aaron said unto all the children of israel at even then ye shall know that the lord hath brought you out from the land of egypt
and in the morning then ye shall see the glory of the lord for that he heareth your murmurings against the lord and what are we that ye murmur against us
and moses said this shall be when the lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread to the full for that the lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him and what are we your murmurings are not against us but against the lord
and moses spake unto aaron say unto all the congregation of the children of israel come near before the lord for he hath heard your murmurings
and it came to pass as aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of israel that they looked toward the wilderness and behold the glory of the lord appeared in the cloud
and the lord spake unto moses saying
i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel speak unto them saying at even ye shall eat flesh and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread and ye shall know that i am the lord your god
and it came to pass that at even the quails came up and covered the camp and in the morning the dew lay round about the host
and when the dew that lay was gone up behold upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing as small as the hoar frost on the ground
and when the children of israel saw it they said one to another it is manna for they wist not what it was and moses said unto them this is the bread which the lord hath given you to eat
this is the thing which the lord hath commanded gather of it every man according to his eating an omer for every man according to the number of your persons take ye every man for them which are in his tents
and the children of israel did so and gathered some more some less
and when they did mete it with an omer he that gathered much had nothing over and he that gathered little had no lack they gathered every man according to his eating
and moses said let no man leave of it till the morning
notwithstanding they hearkened not unto moses but some of them left of it until the morning and it bred worms and stank and moses was wroth with them
and they gathered it every morning every man according to his eating and when the sun waxed hot it melted
and it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread two omers for one man and all the rulers of the congregation came and told moses
and he said unto them this is that which the lord hath said to morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the lord bake that which ye will bake to day and seethe that ye will seethe and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning
and they laid it up till the morning as moses bade and it did not stink neither was there any worm therein
and moses said eat that to day for to day is a sabbath unto the lord to day ye shall not find it in the field
six days ye shall gather it but on the seventh day which is the sabbath in it there shall be none
and it came to pass that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather and they found none
and the lord said unto moses how long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws
see for that the lord hath given you the sabbath therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days abide ye every man in his place let no man go out of his place on the seventh day
so the people rested on the seventh day
and the house of israel called the name thereof manna and it was like coriander seed white and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey
and moses said this is the thing which the lord commandeth fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations that they may see the bread wherewith i have fed you in the wilderness when i brought you forth from the land of egypt
and moses said unto aaron take a pot and put an omer full of manna therein and lay it up before the lord to be kept for your generations
as the lord commanded moses so aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept
and the children of israel did eat manna forty years until they came to a land inhabited they did eat manna until they came unto the borders of the land of canaan
now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah
and all the congregation of the children of israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin after their journeys according to the commandment of the lord and pitched in rephidim and there was no water for the people to drink
wherefore the people did chide with moses and said give us water that we may drink and moses said unto them why chide ye with me wherefore do ye tempt the lord
and the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against moses and said wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst
and moses cried unto the lord saying what shall i do unto this people they be almost ready to stone me
and the lord said unto moses go on before the people and take with thee of the elders of israel and thy rod wherewith thou smotest the river take in thine hand and go
behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel
and he called the name of the place massah and meribah because of the chiding of the children of israel and because they tempted the lord saying is the lord among us or not
then came amalek and fought with israel in rephidim
and moses said unto joshua choose us out men and go out fight with amalek to morrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of god in mine hand
so joshua did as moses had said to him and fought with amalek and moses aaron and hur went up to the top of the hill
and it came to pass when moses held up his hand that israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed
but moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat thereon and aaron and hur stayed up his hands the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun
and joshua discomfited amalek and his people with the edge of the sword
and the lord said unto moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of joshua for i will utterly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven
and moses built an altar and called the name of it jehovahnissi
for he said because the lord hath sworn that the lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation
when jethro the priest of midian moses father in law heard of all that god had done for moses and for israel his people and that the lord had brought israel out of egypt
then jethro moses father in law took zipporah moses wife after he had sent her back
and her two sons of which the name of the one was gershom for he said i have been an alien in a strange land
and the name of the other was eliezer for the god of my father said he was mine help and delivered me from the sword of pharaoh
and jethro moses father in law came with his sons and his wife unto moses into the wilderness where he encamped at the mount of god
and he said unto moses i thy father in law jethro am come unto thee and thy wife and her two sons with her
and moses went out to meet his father in law and did obeisance and kissed him and they asked each other of their welfare and they came into the tent
and moses told his father in law all that the lord had done unto pharaoh and to the egyptians for israel's sake and all the travail that had come upon them by the way and how the lord delivered them
and jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the lord had done to israel whom he had delivered out of the hand of the egyptians
and jethro said blessed be the lord who hath delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of pharaoh who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the egyptians
now i know that the lord is greater than all gods for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them
and jethro moses father in law took a burnt offering and sacrifices for god and aaron came and all the elders of israel to eat bread with moses father in law before god
and it came to pass on the morrow that moses sat to judge the people and the people stood by moses from the morning unto the evening
and when moses father in law saw all that he did to the people he said what is this thing that thou doest to the people why sittest thou thyself alone and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even
and moses said unto his father in law because the people come unto me to enquire of god
when they have a matter they come unto me and i judge between one and another and i do make them know the statutes of god and his laws
and moses father in law said unto him the thing that thou doest is not good
thou wilt surely wear away both thou and this people that is with thee for this thing is too heavy for thee thou art not able to perform it thyself alone
hearken now unto my voice i will give thee counsel and god shall be with thee be thou for the people to godward that thou mayest bring the causes unto god
and thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk and the work that they must do
moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men such as fear god men of truth hating covetousness and place such over them to be rulers of thousands and rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tens
and let them judge the people at all seasons and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto thee but every small matter they shall judge so shall it be easier for thyself and they shall bear the burden with thee
if thou shalt do this thing and god command thee so then thou shalt be able to endure and all this people shall also go to their place in peace
so moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law and did all that he had said
and moses chose able men out of all israel and made them heads over the people rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tens
and they judged the people at all seasons the hard causes they brought unto moses but every small matter they judged themselves
and moses let his father in law depart and he went his way into his own land
in the third month when the children of israel were gone forth out of the land of egypt the same day came they into the wilderness of sinai
for they were departed from rephidim and were come to the desert of sinai and had pitched in the wilderness and there israel camped before the mount
and moses went up unto god and the lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob and tell the children of israel
ye have seen what i did unto the egyptians and how i bare you on eagles wings and brought you unto myself
now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine
and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and an holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel
and moses came and called for the elders of the people and laid before their faces all these words which the lord commanded him
and all the people answered together and said all that the lord hath spoken we will do and moses returned the words of the people unto the lord
and the lord said unto moses lo i come unto thee in a thick cloud that the people may hear when i speak with thee and believe thee for ever and moses told the words of the people unto the lord
and the lord said unto moses go unto the people and sanctify them to day and to morrow and let them wash their clothes
and be ready against the third day for the third day the lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai
and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about saying take heed to yourselves that ye go not up into the mount or touch the border of it whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death
there shall not an hand touch it but he shall surely be stoned or shot through whether it be beast or man it shall not live when the trumpet soundeth long they shall come up to the mount
and moses went down from the mount unto the people and sanctified the people and they washed their clothes
and he said unto the people be ready against the third day come not at your wives
and it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud so that all the people that was in the camp trembled
and moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with god and they stood at the nether part of the mount
and mount sinai was altogether on a smoke because the lord descended upon it in fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole mount quaked greatly
and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder moses spake and god answered him by a voice
and the lord came down upon mount sinai on the top of the mount and the lord called moses up to the top of the mount and moses went up
and the lord said unto moses go down charge the people lest they break through unto the lord to gaze and many of them perish
and let the priests also which come near to the lord sanctify themselves lest the lord break forth upon them
and moses said unto the lord the people cannot come up to mount sinai for thou chargedst us saying set bounds about the mount and sanctify it
and the lord said unto him away get thee down and thou shalt come up thou and aaron with thee but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the lord lest he break forth upon them
so moses went down unto the people and spake unto them
and god spake all these words saying
i am the lord thy god which have brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage
thou shalt have no other gods before me
thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth
thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me
and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments
thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain
remember the sabbath day to keep it holy
six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work
but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates
for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it
honour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee
thou shalt not kill
thou shalt not commit adultery
thou shalt not steal
thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour
thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife nor his manservant nor his maidservant nor his ox nor his ass nor any thing that is thy neighbour's
and all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off
and they said unto moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not god speak with us lest we die
and moses said unto the people fear not for god is come to prove you and that his fear may be before your faces that ye sin not
and the people stood afar off and moses drew near unto the thick darkness where god was
and the lord said unto moses thus thou shalt say unto the children of israel ye have seen that i have talked with you from heaven
ye shall not make with me gods of silver neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold
an altar of earth thou shalt make unto me and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings thy sheep and thine oxen in all places where i record my name i will come unto thee and i will bless thee
and if thou wilt make me an altar of stone thou shalt not build it of hewn stone for if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou hast polluted it
neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon
now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them
if thou buy an hebrew servant six years he shall serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing

if his master have given him a wife and she have born him sons or daughters the wife and her children shall be her master's and he shall go out by himself

if a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass or an ox or a sheep or any beast to keep and it die or be hurt or driven away no man seeing it

and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gathered themselves together unto aaron and said unto him up make us gods which shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him
and aaron said unto them break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me
and all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto aaron
and he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool after he had made it a molten calf and they said these be thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt
and when aaron saw it he built an altar before it and aaron made proclamation and said to morrow is a feast to the lord
and they rose up early on the morrow and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play
and the lord said unto moses go get thee down for thy people which thou broughtest out of the land of egypt have corrupted themselves
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshipped it and have sacrificed thereunto and said these be thy gods o israel which have brought thee up out of the land of egypt
and the lord said unto moses i have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked people
now therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax hot against them and that i may consume them and i will make of thee a great nation
and moses besought the lord his god and said lord why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people which thou hast brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand
wherefore should the egyptians speak and say for mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people
remember abraham isaac and israel thy servants to whom thou swarest by thine own self and saidst unto them i will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that i have spoken of will i give unto your seed and they shall inherit it for ever
and the lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people
and moses turned and went down from the mount and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand the tables were written on both their sides on the one side and on the other were they written
and the tables were the work of god and the writing was the writing of god graven upon the tables
and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto moses there is a noise of war in the camp
and he said it is not the voice of them that shout for mastery neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the noise of them that sing do i hear
and it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and moses anger waxed hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and brake them beneath the mount
and he took the calf which they had made and burnt it in the fire and ground it to powder and strawed it upon the water and made the children of israel drink of it
and moses said unto aaron what did this people unto thee that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them
and aaron said let not the anger of my lord wax hot thou knowest the people that they are set on mischief
for they said unto me make us gods which shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him
and i said unto them whosoever hath any gold let them break it off so they gave it me then i cast it into the fire and there came out this calf
and when moses saw that the people were naked for aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies
then moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the lord's side let him come unto me and all the sons of levi gathered themselves together unto him
and he said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel put every man his sword by his side and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man his companion and every man his neighbour
and the children of levi did according to the word of moses and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men
for moses had said consecrate yourselves today to the lord even every man upon his son and upon his brother that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day
and it came to pass on the morrow that moses said unto the people ye have sinned a great sin and now i will go up unto the lord peradventure i shall make an atonement for your sin
and moses returned unto the lord and said oh this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold
yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin and if not blot me i pray thee out of thy book which thou hast written
and the lord said unto moses whosoever hath sinned against me him will i blot out of my book
therefore now go lead the people unto the place of which i have spoken unto thee behold mine angel shall go before thee nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit their sin upon them
and the lord plagued the people because they made the calf which aaron made
and the lord said unto moses depart and go up hence thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of egypt unto the land which i sware unto abraham to isaac and to jacob saying unto thy seed will i give it
and i will send an angel before thee and i will drive out the canaanite the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite
unto a land flowing with milk and honey for i will not go up in the midst of thee for thou art a stiffnecked people lest i consume thee in the way
and when the people heard these evil tidings they mourned and no man did put on him his ornaments
for the lord had said unto moses say unto the children of israel ye are a stiffnecked people i will come up into the midst of thee in a moment and consume thee therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee that i may know what to do unto thee
and the children of israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount horeb
and moses took the tabernacle and pitched it without the camp afar off from the camp and called it the tabernacle of the congregation and it came to pass that every one which sought the lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation which was without the camp
and it came to pass when moses went out unto the tabernacle that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and looked after moses until he was gone into the tabernacle
and it came to pass as moses entered into the tabernacle the cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle and the lord talked with moses
and all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshipped every man in his tent door
and the lord spake unto moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the tabernacle
and moses said unto the lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me yet thou hast said i know thee by name and thou hast also found grace in my sight
now therefore i pray thee if i have found grace in thy sight shew me now thy way that i may know thee that i may find grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people
and he said my presence shall go with thee and i will give thee rest
and he said unto him if thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence
for wherein shall it be known here that i and thy people have found grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us so shall we be separated i and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth
and the lord said unto moses i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight and i know thee by name
and he said i beseech thee shew me thy glory
and he said i will make all my goodness pass before thee and i will proclaim the name of the lord before thee and will be gracious to whom i will be gracious and will shew mercy on whom i will shew mercy
and he said thou canst not see my face for there shall no man see me and live
and the lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock
and it shall come to pass while my glory passeth by that i will put thee in a clift of the rock and will cover thee with my hand while i pass by
and i will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back parts but my face shall not be seen
and the lord said unto moses hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first and i will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest
and be ready in the morning and come up in the morning unto mount sinai and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount
and no man shall come up with thee neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount
and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and moses rose up early in the morning and went up unto mount sinai as the lord had commanded him and took in his hand the two tables of stone
and the lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the lord
and the lord passed by before him and proclaimed the lord the lord god merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth
keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the children's children unto the third and to the fourth generation
and moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped
and he said if now i have found grace in thy sight o lord let my lord i pray thee go among us for it is a stiffnecked people and pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for thine inheritance
and he said behold i make a covenant before all thy people i will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth nor in any nation and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the lord for it is a terrible thing that i will do with thee
observe thou that which i command thee this day behold i drive out before thee the amorite and the canaanite and the hittite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite
take heed to thyself lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee
but ye shall destroy their altars break their images and cut down their groves
for thou shalt worship no other god for the lord whose name is jealous is a jealous god
lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they go a whoring after their gods and do sacrifice unto their gods and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice
and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons and their daughters go a whoring after their gods and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods
thou shalt make thee no molten gods
the feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread as i commanded thee in the time of the month abib for in the month abib thou camest out from egypt
all that openeth the matrix is mine and every firstling among thy cattle whether ox or sheep that is male
but the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou redeem him not then shalt thou break his neck all the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem and none shall appear before me empty
six days thou shalt work but on the seventh day thou shalt rest in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest
and thou shalt observe the feast of weeks of the firstfruits of wheat harvest and the feast of ingathering at the year's end
thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the lord god the god of israel
for i will cast out the nations before thee and enlarge thy borders neither shall any man desire thy land when thou shalt go up to appear before the lord thy god thrice in the year
thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning
the first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the lord thy god thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk
and the lord said unto moses write thou these words for after the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with thee and with israel
and he was there with the lord forty days and forty nights he did neither eat bread nor drink water and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant the ten commandments
and it came to pass when moses came down from mount sinai with the two tables of testimony in moses hand when he came down from the mount that moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him
and when aaron and all the children of israel saw moses behold the skin of his face shone and they were afraid to come nigh him
and moses called unto them and aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him and moses talked with them
and afterward all the children of israel came nigh and he gave them in commandment all that the lord had spoken with him in mount sinai
and till moses had done speaking with them he put a vail on his face
but when moses went in before the lord to speak with him he took the vail off until he came out and he came out and spake unto the children of israel that which he was commanded
and the children of israel saw the face of moses that the skin of moses face shone and moses put the vail upon his face again until he went in to speak with him
and moses gathered all the congregation of the children of israel together and said unto them these are the words which the lord hath commanded that ye should do them
six days shall work be done but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day a sabbath of rest to the lord whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death
ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day
and moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of israel saying this is the thing which the lord commanded saying

and they brought that which moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation and all the congregation drew near and stood before the lord
and moses said this is the thing which the lord commanded that ye should do and the glory of the lord shall appear unto you
and moses said unto aaron go unto the altar and offer thy sin offering and thy burnt offering and make an atonement for thyself and for the people and offer the offering of the people and make an atonement for them as the lord commanded
aaron therefore went unto the altar and slew the calf of the sin offering which was for himself
and the sons of aaron brought the blood unto him and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar
but the fat and the kidneys and the caul above the liver of the sin offering he burnt upon the altar as the lord commanded moses
and the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp
and he slew the burnt offering and aaron's sons presented unto him the blood which he sprinkled round about upon the altar
and they presented the burnt offering unto him with the pieces thereof and the head and he burnt them upon the altar
and he did wash the inwards and the legs and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar
and he brought the people's offering and took the goat which was the sin offering for the people and slew it and offered it for sin as the first
and he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the manner
and he brought the meat offering and took an handful thereof and burnt it upon the altar beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning
he slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people and aaron's sons presented unto him the blood which he sprinkled upon the altar round about
and the fat of the bullock and of the ram the rump and that which covereth the inwards and the kidneys and the caul above the liver
and they put the fat upon the breasts and he burnt the fat upon the altar
and the breasts and the right shoulder aaron waved for a wave offering before the lord as moses commanded
and aaron lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them and came down from offering of the sin offering and the burnt offering and peace offerings
and moses and aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation and came out and blessed the people and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the people
and there came a fire out from before the lord and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when all the people saw they shouted and fell on their faces
and nadab and abihu the sons of aaron took either of them his censer and put fire therein and put incense thereon and offered strange fire before the lord which he commanded them not
and there went out fire from the lord and devoured them and they died before the lord
then moses said unto aaron this is it that the lord spake saying i will be sanctified in them that come nigh me and before all the people i will be glorified and aaron held his peace
and moses called mishael and elzaphan the sons of uzziel the uncle of aaron and said unto them come near carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp
so they went near and carried them in their coats out of the camp as moses had said
and moses said unto aaron and unto eleazar and unto ithamar his sons uncover not your heads neither rend your clothes lest ye die and lest wrath come upon all the people but let your brethren the whole house of israel bewail the burning which the lord hath kindled
and ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation lest ye die for the anointing oil of the lord is upon you and they did according to the word of moses
and the lord spake unto aaron saying
do not drink wine nor strong drink thou nor thy sons with thee when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation lest ye die it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations
and that ye may put difference between holy and unholy and between unclean and clean
and that ye may teach the children of israel all the statutes which the lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of moses
and moses spake unto aaron and unto eleazar and unto ithamar his sons that were left take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the lord made by fire and eat it without leaven beside the altar for it is most holy
and ye shall eat it in the holy place because it is thy due and thy sons due of the sacrifices of the lord made by fire for so i am commanded
and the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place thou and thy sons and thy daughters with thee for they be thy due and thy sons due which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of israel
the heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat to wave it for a wave offering before the lord and it shall be thine and thy sons with thee by a statute for ever as the lord hath commanded
and moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering and behold it was burnt and he was angry with eleazar and ithamar the sons of aaron which were left alive saying
wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place seeing it is most holy and god hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation to make atonement for them before the lord
behold the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place as i commanded
and aaron said unto moses behold this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the lord and such things have befallen me and if i had eaten the sin offering to day should it have been accepted in the sight of the lord
and when moses heard that he was content
and the lord spake unto moses and to aaron saying unto them
speak unto the children of israel saying these are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth
whatsoever parteth the hoof and is clovenfooted and cheweth the cud among the beasts that shall ye eat

they shall be even an abomination unto you ye shall not eat of their flesh but ye shall have their carcases in abomination
whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters that shall be an abomination unto you
and these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls they shall not be eaten they are an abomination the eagle and the ossifrage and the ospray

yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four which have legs above their feet to leap withal upon the earth
even these of them ye may eat the locust after his kind and the bald locust after his kind and the beetle after his kind and the grasshopper after his kind
but all other flying creeping things which have four feet shall be an abomination unto you
and for these ye shall be unclean whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even
and whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even

this is the law of the beasts and of the fowl and of every living creature that moveth in the waters and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth
to make a difference between the unclean and the clean and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel saying if a woman have conceived seed and born a man child then she shall be unclean seven days according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean
and in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised
and she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days she shall touch no hallowed thing nor come into the sanctuary until the days of her purifying be fulfilled

what man soever there be of the house of israel that killeth an ox or lamb or goat in the camp or that killeth it out of the camp
and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation to offer an offering unto the lord before the tabernacle of the lord blood shall be imputed unto that man he hath shed blood and that man shall be cut off from among his people

and whatsoever man there be of the house of israel or of the strangers that sojourn among you that eateth any manner of blood i will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood and will cut him off from among his people
for the life of the flesh is in the blood and i have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul
therefore i said unto the children of israel no soul of you shall eat blood neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood
and whatsoever man there be of the children of israel or of the strangers that sojourn among you which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten he shall even pour out the blood thereof and cover it with dust
for it is the life of all flesh the blood of it is for the life thereof therefore i said unto the children of israel ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof whosoever eateth it shall be cut off
and every soul that eateth that which died of itself or that which was torn with beasts whether it be one of your own country or a stranger he shall both wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even then shall he be clean

and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you for thee and for thy servant and for thy maid and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee
and for thy cattle and for the beast that are in thy land shall all the increase thereof be meat
and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years
then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land
and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubile unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family
a jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you ye shall not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed
for it is the jubile it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field
in the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession
and if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand ye shall not oppress one another
according to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee
according to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee
ye shall not therefore oppress one another but thou shalt fear thy godfor i am the lord your god
wherefore ye shall do my statutes and keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land in safety
and the land shall yield her fruit and ye shall eat your fill and dwell therein in safety
and if ye shall say what shall we eat the seventh year behold we shall not sow nor gather in our increase
then i will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year and it shall bring forth fruit for three years
and ye shall sow the eighth year and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store
the land shall not be sold for ever for the land is mine for ye are strangers and sojourners with me
and in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land
if thy brother be waxen poor and hath sold away some of his possession and if any of his kin come to redeem it then shall he redeem that which his brother sold
and if the man have none to redeem it and himself be able to redeem it
then let him count the years of the sale thereof and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it that he may return unto his possession
but if he be not able to restore it to him then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile and in the jubile it shall go out and he shall return unto his possession
and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold within a full year may he redeem it
and if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations it shall not go out in the jubile
but the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country they may be redeemed and they shall go out in the jubile
notwithstanding the cities of the levites and the houses of the cities of their possession may the levites redeem at any time
and if a man purchase of the levites then the house that was sold and the city of his possession shall go out in the year of jubile for the houses of the cities of the levites are their possession among the children of israel
but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold for it is their perpetual possession
and if thy brother be waxen poor and fallen in decay with thee then thou shalt relieve him yea though he be a stranger or a sojourner that he may live with thee
take thou no usury of him or increase but fear thy god that thy brother may live with thee
thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury nor lend him thy victuals for increase
i am the lord your god which brought you forth out of the land of egypt to give you the land of canaan and to be your god
and if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor and be sold unto thee thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant
but as an hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with thee and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile
and then shall he depart from thee both he and his children with him and shall return unto his own family and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return
for they are my servants which i brought forth out of the land of egypt they shall not be sold as bondmen
thou shalt not rule over him with rigour but shalt fear thy god
both thy bondmen and thy bondmaids which thou shalt have shall be of the heathen that are round about you of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids
moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you of them shall ye buy and of their families that are with you which they begat in your land and they shall be your possession
and ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you to inherit them for a possession they shall be your bondmen for ever but over your brethren the children of israel ye shall not rule one over another with rigour
and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee or to the stock of the stranger's family
after that he is sold he may be redeemed again one of his brethren may redeem him
either his uncle or his uncle's son may redeem him or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him or if he be able he may redeem himself
and he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him
if there be yet many years behind according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for
and if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile then he shall count with him and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption
and as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight
and if he be not redeemed in these years then he shall go out in the year of jubile both he and his children with him
for unto me the children of israel are servants they are my servants whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt i am the lord your god
ye shall make you no idols nor graven image neither rear you up a standing image neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land to bow down unto it for i am the lord your god
ye shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary i am the lord
if ye walk in my statutes and keep my commandments and do them
then i will give you rain in due season and the land shall yield her increase and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit
and your threshing shall reach unto the vintage and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time and ye shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land safely
and i will give peace in the land and ye shall lie down and none shall make you afraid and i will rid evil beasts out of the land neither shall the sword go through your land
and ye shall chase your enemies and they shall fall before you by the sword
and five of you shall chase an hundred and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword
for i will have respect unto you and make you fruitful and multiply you and establish my covenant with you
and ye shall eat old store and bring forth the old because of the new
and i will set my tabernacle among you and my soul shall not abhor you
and i will walk among you and will be your god and ye shall be my people
i am the lord your god which brought you forth out of the land of egypt that ye should not be their bondmen and i have broken the bands of your yoke and made you go upright
but if ye will not hearken unto me and will not do all these commandments
and if ye shall despise my statutes or if your soul abhor my judgments so that ye will not do all my commandments but that ye break my covenant
i also will do this unto you i will even appoint over you terror consumption and the burning ague that shall consume the eyes and cause sorrow of heart and ye shall sow your seed in vain for your enemies shall eat it
and i will set my face against you and ye shall be slain before your enemies they that hate you shall reign over you and ye shall flee when none pursueth you
and if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me then i will punish you seven times more for your sins
and i will break the pride of your power and i will make your heaven as iron and your earth as brass
and your strength shall be spent in vain for your land shall not yield her increase neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits
and if ye walk contrary unto me and will not hearken unto me i will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins
i will also send wild beasts among you which shall rob you of your children and destroy your cattle and make you few in number and your high ways shall be desolate
and if ye will not be reformed by me by these things but will walk contrary unto me
then will i also walk contrary unto you and will punish you yet seven times for your sins
and i will bring a sword upon you that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant and when ye are gathered together within your cities i will send the pestilence among you and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy
and when i have broken the staff of your bread ten women shall bake your bread in one oven and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight and ye shall eat and not be satisfied
and if ye will not for all this hearken unto me but walk contrary unto me
then i will walk contrary unto you also in fury and i even i will chastise you seven times for your sins
and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat
and i will destroy your high places and cut down your images and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols and my soul shall abhor you
and i will make your cities waste and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation and i will not smell the savour of your sweet odours
and i will bring the land into desolation and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it
and i will scatter you among the heathen and will draw out a sword after you and your land shall be desolate and your cities waste
then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths as long as it lieth desolate and ye be in your enemies land even then shall the land rest and enjoy her sabbaths
as long as it lieth desolate it shall rest because it did not rest in your sabbaths when ye dwelt upon it
and upon them that are left alive of you i will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them and they shall flee as fleeing from a sword and they shall fall when none pursueth
and they shall fall one upon another as it were before a sword when none pursueth and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies
and ye shall perish among the heathen and the land of your enemies shall eat you up
and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies lands and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them
if they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers with their trespass which they trespassed against me and that also they have walked contrary unto me
and that i also have walked contrary unto them and have brought them into the land of their enemies if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity
then will i remember my covenant with jacob and also my covenant with isaac and also my covenant with abraham will i remember and i will remember the land
the land also shall be left of them and shall enjoy her sabbaths while she lieth desolate without them and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity because even because they despised my judgments and because their soul abhorred my statutes
and yet for all that when they be in the land of their enemies i will not cast them away neither will i abhor them to destroy them utterly and to break my covenant with them for i am the lord their god
but i will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt in the sight of the heathen that i might be their god i am the lord
these are the statutes and judgments and laws which the lord made between him and the children of israel in mount sinai by the hand of moses
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when a man shall make a singular vow the persons shall be for the lord by thy estimation

and if it be from sixty years old and above if it be a male then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels and for the female ten shekels
but if he be poorer than thy estimation then he shall present himself before the priest and the priest shall value him according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him
and if it be a beast whereof men bring an offering unto the lord all that any man giveth of such unto the lord shall be holy
he shall not alter it nor change it a good for a bad or a bad for a good and if he shall at all change beast for beast then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy
and if it be any unclean beast of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the lord then he shall present the beast before the priest
and the priest shall value it whether it be good or bad as thou valuest it who art the priest so shall it be
but if he will at all redeem it then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation
and when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the lord then the priest shall estimate it whether it be good or bad as the priest shall estimate it so shall it stand
and if he that sanctified it will redeem his house then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it and it shall be his
and if a man shall sanctify unto the lord some part of a field of his possession then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver
if he sanctify his field from the year of jubile according to thy estimation it shall stand
but if he sanctify his field after the jubile then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain even unto the year of the jubile and it shall be abated from thy estimation
and if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it and it shall be assured to him
and if he will not redeem the field or if he have sold the field to another man it shall not be redeemed any more
but the field when it goeth out in the jubile shall be holy unto the lord as a field devoted the possession thereof shall be the priest's
and if a man sanctify unto the lord a field which he hath bought which is not of the fields of his possession
then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation even unto the year of the jubile and he shall give thine estimation in that day as a holy thing unto the lord
in the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong
and all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary twenty gerahs shall be the shekel
only the firstling of the beasts which should be the lord's firstling no man shall sanctify it whether it be ox or sheep it is the lord's
and if it be of an unclean beast then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation and shall add a fifth part of it thereto or if it be not redeemed then it shall be sold according to thy estimation
notwithstanding no devoted thing that a man shall devote unto the lord of all that he hath both of man and beast and of the field of his possession shall be sold or redeemed every devoted thing is most holy unto the lord
none devoted which shall be devoted of men shall be redeemed but shall surely be put to death
and all the tithe of the land whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree is the lord's it is holy unto the lord
and if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof
and concerning the tithe of the herd or of the flock even of whatsoever passeth under the rod the tenth shall be holy unto the lord
he shall not search whether it be good or bad neither shall he change it and if he change it at all then both it and the change thereof shall be holy it shall not be redeemed

even those that were numbered of them were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore
according to the commandment of the lord they were numbered by the hand of moses every one according to his service and according to his burden thus were they numbered of him as the lord commanded moses
and the lord spake unto moses saying
command the children of israel that they put out of the camp every leper and every one that hath an issue and whosoever is defiled by the dead
both male and female shall ye put out without the camp shall ye put them that they defile not their camps in the midst whereof i dwell
and the children of israel did so and put them out without the camp as the lord spake unto moses so did the children of israel
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel when a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit to do a trespass against the lord and that person be guilty
then they shall confess their sin which they have done and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof and add unto it the fifth part thereof and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed
but if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto let the trespass be recompensed unto the lord even to the priest beside the ram of the atonement whereby an atonement shall be made for him
and every offering of all the holy things of the children of israel which they bring unto the priest shall be his
and every man's hallowed things shall be his whatsoever any man giveth the priest it shall be his
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them if any man's wife go aside and commit a trespass against him
and a man lie with her carnally and it be hid from the eyes of her husband and be kept close and she be defiled and there be no witness against her neither she be taken with the manner
and the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be defiled or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be not defiled
then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest and he shall bring her offering for her the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal he shall pour no oil upon it nor put frankincense thereon for it is an offering of jealousy an offering of memorial bringing iniquity to remembrance
and the priest shall bring her near and set her before the lord
and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take and put it into the water
and the priest shall set the woman before the lord and uncover the woman's head and put the offering of memorial in her hands which is the jealousy offering and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse
and the priest shall charge her by an oath and say unto the woman if no man have lain with thee and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse
but if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband and if thou be defiled and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband
then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing and the priest shall say unto the woman the lord make thee a curse and an oath among thy people when the lord doth make thy thigh to rot and thy belly to swell
and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels to make thy belly to swell and thy thigh to rot and the woman shall say amen amen
and the priest shall write these curses in a book and he shall blot them out with the bitter water
and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter
then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand and shall wave the offering before the lord and offer it upon the altar
and the priest shall take an handful of the offering even the memorial thereof and burn it upon the altar and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water
and when he hath made her to drink the water then it shall come to pass that if she be defiled and have done trespass against her husband that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter and her belly shall swell and her thigh shall rot and the woman shall be a curse among her people
and if the woman be not defiled but be clean then she shall be free and shall conceive seed
this is the law of jealousies when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband and is defiled
or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him and he be jealous over his wife and shall set the woman before the lord and the priest shall execute upon her all this law
then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity and this woman shall bear her iniquity
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a nazarite to separate themselves unto the lord
he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink and shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes nor eat moist grapes or dried
all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree from the kernels even to the husk
all the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head until the days be fulfilled in the which he separateth himself unto the lord he shall be holy and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow
all the days that he separateth himself unto the lord he shall come at no dead body
he shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother for his brother or for his sister when they die because the consecration of his god is upon his head
all the days of his separation he is holy unto the lord
and if any man die very suddenly by him and he hath defiled the head of his consecration then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing on the seventh day shall he shave it
and on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles or two young pigeons to the priest to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering and make an atonement for him for that he sinned by the dead and shall hallow his head that same day
and he shall consecrate unto the lord the days of his separation and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering but the days that were before shall be lost because his separation was defiled
and this is the law of the nazarite when the days of his separation are fulfilled he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
and he shall offer his offering unto the lord one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering and one ram without blemish for peace offerings
and a basket of unleavened bread cakes of fine flour mingled with oil and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil and their meat offering and their drink offerings
and the priest shall bring them before the lord and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering
and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the lord with the basket of unleavened bread the priest shall offer also his meat offering and his drink offering
and the nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and shall take the hair of the head of his separation and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings
and the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram and one unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer and shall put them upon the hands of the nazarite after the hair of his separation is shaven
and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the lord this is holy for the priest with the wave breast and heave shoulder and after that the nazarite may drink wine
this is the law of the nazarite who hath vowed and of his offering unto the lord for his separation beside that that his hand shall get according to the vow which he vowed so he must do after the law of his separation
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto aaron and unto his sons saying on this wise ye shall bless the children of israel saying unto them
the lord bless thee and keep thee
the lord make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee
the lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace
and they shall put my name upon the children of israel and i will bless them

and the lord spake unto moses saying
take the levites from among the children of israel and cleanse them
and thus shalt thou do unto them to cleanse them sprinkle water of purifying upon them and let them shave all their flesh and let them wash their clothes and so make themselves clean
then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering even fine flour mingled with oil and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering
and thou shalt bring the levites before the tabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of israel together
and thou shalt bring the levites before the lord and the children of israel shall put their hands upon the levites
and aaron shall offer the levites before the lord for an offering of the children of israel that they may execute the service of the lord
and the levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering unto the lord to make an atonement for the levites
and thou shalt set the levites before aaron and before his sons and offer them for an offering unto the lord
thus shalt thou separate the levites from among the children of israel and the levites shall be mine
and after that shall the levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt cleanse them and offer them for an offering
for they are wholly given unto me from among the children of israel instead of such as open every womb even instead of the firstborn of all the children of israel have i taken them unto me
for all the firstborn of the children of israel are mine both man and beast on the day that i smote every firstborn in the land of egypt i sanctified them for myself
and i have taken the levites for all the firstborn of the children of israel
and i have given the levites as a gift to aaron and to his sons from among the children of israel to do the service of the children of israel in the tabernacle of the congregation and to make an atonement for the children of israel that there be no plague among the children of israel when the children of israel come nigh unto the sanctuary

and after that went the levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before aaron and before his sons as the lord had commanded moses concerning the levites so did they unto them
and the lord spake unto moses saying
this is it that belongeth unto the levites from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation
and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof and shall serve no more
but shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation to keep the charge and shall do no service thus shalt thou do unto the levites touching their charge
and the lord spake unto moses in the wilderness of sinai in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of egypt saying
let the children of israel also keep the passover at his appointed season
in the fourteenth day of this month at even ye shall keep it in his appointed season according to all the rites of it and according to all the ceremonies thereof shall ye keep it
and moses spake unto the children of israel that they should keep the passover
and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of sinai according to all that the lord commanded moses so did the children of israel
and there were certain men who were defiled by the dead body of a man that they could not keep the passover on that day and they came before moses and before aaron on that day
and those men said unto him we are defiled by the dead body of a man wherefore are we kept back that we may not offer an offering of the lord in his appointed season among the children of israel
and moses said unto them stand still and i will hear what the lord will command concerning you
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel saying if any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body or be in a journey afar off yet he shall keep the passover unto the lord
the fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs
they shall leave none of it unto the morning nor break any bone of it according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it
but the man that is clean and is not in a journey and forbeareth to keep the passover even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people because he brought not the offering of the lord in his appointed season that man shall bear his sin
and if a stranger shall sojourn among you and will keep the passover unto the lord according to the ordinance of the passover and according to the manner thereof so shall he do ye shall have one ordinance both for the stranger and for him that was born in the land
and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle namely the tent of the testimony and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire until the morning
so it was alway the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night
and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle then after that the children of israel journeyed and in the place where the cloud abode there the children of israel pitched their tents
at the commandment of the lord the children of israel journeyed and at the commandment of the lord they pitched as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents
and when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days then the children of israel kept the charge of the lord and journeyed not
and so it was when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle according to the commandment of the lord they abode in their tents and according to the commandment of the lord they journeyed
and so it was when the cloud abode from even unto the morning and that the cloud was taken up in the morning then they journeyed whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up they journeyed
or whether it were two days or a month or a year that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle remaining thereon the children of israel abode in their tents and journeyed not but when it was taken up they journeyed
at the commandment of the lord they rested in the tents and at the commandment of the lord they journeyed they kept the charge of the lord at the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses
and the lord spake unto moses saying
make thee two trumpets of silver of a whole piece shalt thou make them that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly and for the journeying of the camps
and when they shall blow with them all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
and if they blow but with one trumpet then the princes which are heads of the thousands of israel shall gather themselves unto thee
when ye blow an alarm then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward
when ye blow an alarm the second time then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey they shall blow an alarm for their journeys
but when the congregation is to be gathered together ye shall blow but ye shall not sound an alarm
and the sons of aaron the priests shall blow with the trumpets and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations
and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets and ye shall be remembered before the lord your god and ye shall be saved from your enemies
also in the day of your gladness and in your solemn days and in the beginnings of your months ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings that they may be to you for a memorial before your god i am the lord your god
and it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month in the second year that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony
and the children of israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of sinai and the cloud rested in the wilderness of paran
and they first took their journey according to the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses

and moses said unto hobab the son of raguel the midianite moses father in law we are journeying unto the place of which the lord said i will give it you come thou with us and we will do thee good for the lord hath spoken good concerning israel
and he said unto him i will not go but i will depart to mine own land and to my kindred
and he said leave us not i pray thee forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes
and it shall be if thou go with us yea it shall be that what goodness the lord shall do unto us the same will we do unto thee
and they departed from the mount of the lord three days journey and the ark of the covenant of the lord went before them in the three days journey to search out a resting place for them
and the cloud of the lord was upon them by day when they went out of the camp
and it came to pass when the ark set forward that moses said rise up lord and let thine enemies be scattered and let them that hate thee flee before thee
and when it rested he said return o lord unto the many thousands of israel
and when the people complained it displeased the lord and the lord heard it and his anger was kindled and the fire of the lord burnt among them and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp
and the people cried unto moses and when moses prayed unto the lord the fire was quenched
and he called the name of the place taberah because the fire of the lord burnt among them
and the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting and the children of israel also wept again and said who shall give us flesh to eat
we remember the fish which we did eat in egypt freely the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlick
but now our soul is dried away there is nothing at all beside this manna before our eyes
and the manna was as coriander seed and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium
and the people went about and gathered it and ground it in mills or beat it in a mortar and baked it in pans and made cakes of it and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil
and when the dew fell upon the camp in the night the manna fell upon it
then moses heard the people weep throughout their families every man in the door of his tent and the anger of the lord was kindled greatly moses also was displeased
and moses said unto the lord wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant and wherefore have i not found favour in thy sight that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me
have i conceived all this people have i begotten them that thou shouldest say unto me carry them in thy bosom as a nursing father beareth the sucking child unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers
whence should i have flesh to give unto all this people for they weep unto me saying give us flesh that we may eat
i am not able to bear all this people alone because it is too heavy for me
and if thou deal thus with me kill me i pray thee out of hand if i have found favour in thy sight and let me not see my wretchedness
and the lord said unto moses gather unto me seventy men of the elders of israel whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people and officers over them and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation that they may stand there with thee
and i will come down and talk with thee there and i will take of the spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon them and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee that thou bear it not thyself alone
and say thou unto the people sanctify yourselves against to morrow and ye shall eat flesh for ye have wept in the ears of the lord saying who shall give us flesh to eat for it was well with us in egypt therefore the lord will give you flesh and ye shall eat
ye shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neither ten days nor twenty days
but even a whole month until it come out at your nostrils and it be loathsome unto you because that ye have despised the lord which is among you and have wept before him saying why came we forth out of egypt
and moses said the people among whom i am are six hundred thousand footmen and thou hast said i will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month
shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them to suffice them or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them to suffice them
and the lord said unto moses is the lord's hand waxed short thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not
and moses went out and told the people the words of the lord and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and set them round about the tabernacle
and the lord came down in a cloud and spake unto him and took of the spirit that was upon him and gave it unto the seventy elders and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them they prophesied and did not cease
but there remained two of the men in the camp the name of the one was eldad and the name of the other medad and the spirit rested upon them and they were of them that were written but went not out unto the tabernacle and they prophesied in the camp
and there ran a young man and told moses and said eldad and medad do prophesy in the camp
and joshua the son of nun the servant of moses one of his young men answered and said my lord moses forbid them
and moses said unto him enviest thou for my sake would god that all the lord's people were prophets and that the lord would put his spirit upon them
and moses gat him into the camp he and the elders of israel
and there went forth a wind from the lord and brought quails from the sea and let them fall by the camp as it were a day's journey on this side and as it were a day's journey on the other side round about the camp and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth
and the people stood up all that day and all that night and all the next day and they gathered the quails he that gathered least gathered ten homers and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp
and while the flesh was yet between their teeth ere it was chewed the wrath of the lord was kindled against the people and the lord smote the people with a very great plague
and he called the name of that place kibrothhattaavah because there they buried the people that lusted
and the people journeyed from kibrothhattaavah unto hazeroth and abode at hazeroth
and miriam and aaron spake against moses because of the ethiopian woman whom he had married for he had married an ethiopian woman
and they said hath the lord indeed spoken only by moses hath he not spoken also by us and the lord heard it
now the man moses was very meek above all the men which were upon the face of the earth
and the lord spake suddenly unto moses and unto aaron and unto miriam come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation and they three came out
and the lord came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle and called aaron and miriam and they both came forth
and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you i the lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream
my servant moses is not so who is faithful in all mine house
with him will i speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches and the similitude of the lord shall he behold wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant moses
and the anger of the lord was kindled against them and he departed
and the cloud departed from off the tabernacle and behold miriam became leprous white as snow and aaron looked upon miriam and behold she was leprous
and aaron said unto moses alas my lord i beseech thee lay not the sin upon us wherein we have done foolishly and wherein we have sinned
let her not be as one dead of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb
and moses cried unto the lord saying heal her now o god i beseech thee
and the lord said unto moses if her father had but spit in her face should she not be ashamed seven days let her be shut out from the camp seven days and after that let her be received in again
and miriam was shut out from the camp seven days and the people journeyed not till miriam was brought in again
and afterward the people removed from hazeroth and pitched in the wilderness of paran
and the lord spake unto moses saying
send thou men that they may search the land of canaan which i give unto the children of israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man every one a ruler among them
and moses by the commandment of the lord sent them from the wilderness of paran all those men were heads of the children of israel
and these were their names of the tribe of reuben shammua the son of zaccur
of the tribe of simeon shaphat the son of hori
of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh
of the tribe of issachar igal the son of joseph
of the tribe of ephraim oshea the son of nun
of the tribe of benjamin palti the son of raphu
of the tribe of zebulun gaddiel the son of sodi
of the tribe of joseph namely of the tribe of manasseh gaddi the son of susi
of the tribe of dan ammiel the son of gemalli
of the tribe of asher sethur the son of michael
of the tribe of naphtali nahbi the son of vophsi
of the tribe of gad geuel the son of machi
these are the names of the men which moses sent to spy out the land and moses called oshea the son of nun jehoshua
and moses sent them to spy out the land of canaan and said unto them get you up this way southward and go up into the mountain
and see the land what it is and the people that dwelleth therein whether they be strong or weak few or many
and what the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad and what cities they be that they dwell in whether in tents or in strong holds
and what the land is whether it be fat or lean whether there be wood therein or not and be ye of good courage and bring of the fruit of the land now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes
so they went up and searched the land from the wilderness of zin unto rehob as men come to hamath
and they ascended by the south and came unto hebron where ahiman sheshai and talmai the children of anak were now hebron was built seven years before zoan in egypt
and they came unto the brook of eshcol and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bare it between two upon a staff and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs
the place was called the brook eshcol because of the cluster of grapes which the children of israel cut down from thence
and they returned from searching of the land after forty days
and they went and came to moses and to aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of paran to kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and shewed them the fruit of the land
and they told him and said we came unto the land whither thou sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it
nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there
the amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of jordan
and caleb stilled the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it
but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we
and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature
and there we saw the giants the sons of anak which come of the giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight
and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night
and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would god that we had died in the land of egypt or would god we had died in this wilderness
and wherefore hath the lord brought us unto this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey were it not better for us to return into egypt
and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into egypt
then moses and aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of israel
and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes
and they spake unto all the company of the children of israel saying the land which we passed through to search it is an exceeding good land
if the lord delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it us a land which floweth with milk and honey
only rebel not ye against the lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bread for us their defence is departed from them and the lord is with us fear them not
but all the congregation bade stone them with stones and the glory of the lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of israel
and the lord said unto moses how long will this people provoke me and how long will it be ere they believe me for all the signs which i have shewed among them
i will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they
and moses said unto the lord then the egyptians shall hear it for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them
and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land for they have heard that thou lord art among this people that thou lord art seen face to face and that thy cloud standeth over them and that thou goest before them by day time in a pillar of a cloud and in a pillar of fire by night
now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak saying
because the lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness
and now i beseech thee let the power of my lord be great according as thou hast spoken saying
the lord is longsuffering and of great mercy forgiving iniquity and transgression and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation
pardon i beseech thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou hast forgiven this people from egypt even until now
and the lord said i have pardoned according to thy word
but as truly as i live all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the lord
because all those men which have seen my glory and my miracles which i did in egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these ten times and have not hearkened to my voice
surely they shall not see the land which i sware unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoked me see it
but my servant caleb because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully him will i bring into the land whereinto he went and his seed shall possess it
now the amalekites and the canaanites dwelt in the valley tomorrow turn you and get you into the wilderness by the way of the red sea
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying
how long shall i bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel which they murmur against me
say unto them as truly as i live saith the lord as ye have spoken in mine ears so will i do to you
your carcases shall fall in this wilderness and all that were numbered of you according to your whole number from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against me
doubtless ye shall not come into the land concerning which i sware to make you dwell therein save caleb the son of jephunneh and joshua the son of nun
but your little ones which ye said should be a prey them will i bring in and they shall know the land which ye have despised
but as for you your carcases they shall fall in this wilderness
and your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years and bear your whoredoms until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness
after the number of the days in which ye searched the land even forty days each day for a year shall ye bear your iniquities even forty years and ye shall know my breach of promise
i the lord have said i will surely do it unto all this evil congregation that are gathered together against me in this wilderness they shall be consumed and there they shall die
and the men which moses sent to search the land who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up a slander upon the land
even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land died by the plague before the lord
but joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh which were of the men that went to search the land lived still
and moses told these sayings unto all the children of israel and the people mourned greatly
and they rose up early in the morning and gat them up into the top of the mountain saying lo we be here and will go up unto the place which the lord hath promised for we have sinned
and moses said wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the lord but it shall not prosper
go not up for the lord is not among you that ye be not smitten before your enemies
for the amalekites and the canaanites are there before you and ye shall fall by the sword because ye are turned away from the lord therefore the lord will not be with you
but they presumed to go up unto the hill top nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the lord and moses departed not out of the camp
then the amalekites came down and the canaanites which dwelt in that hill and smote them and discomfited them even unto hormah
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye be come into the land of your habitations which i give unto you
and will make an offering by fire unto the lord a burnt offering or a sacrifice in performing a vow or in a freewill offering or in your solemn feasts to make a sweet savour unto the lord of the herd or of the flock
then shall he that offereth his offering unto the lord bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil
and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice for one lamb
or for a ram thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil
and for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine for a sweet savour unto the lord
and when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering or for a sacrifice in performing a vow or peace offerings unto the lord
then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil
and thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine for an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord
thus shall it be done for one bullock or for one ram or for a lamb or a kid
according to the number that ye shall prepare so shall ye do to every one according to their number
all that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner in offering an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord
and if a stranger sojourn with you or whosoever be among you in your generations and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord as ye do so he shall do
one ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you an ordinance for ever in your generations as ye are so shall the stranger be before the lord
one law and one manner shall be for you and for the stranger that sojourneth with you
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land whither i bring you
then it shall be that when ye eat of the bread of the land ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the lord
ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor so shall ye heave it
of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the lord an heave offering in your generations
and if ye have erred and not observed all these commandments which the lord hath spoken unto moses
even all that the lord hath commanded you by the hand of moses from the day that the lord commanded moses and henceforward among your generations
then it shall be if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the lord with his meat offering and his drink offering according to the manner and one kid of the goats for a sin offering
and the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of israel and it shall be forgiven them for it is ignorance and they shall bring their offering a sacrifice made by fire unto the lord and their sin offering before the lord for their ignorance
and it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of israel and the stranger that sojourneth among them seeing all the people were in ignorance
and if any soul sin through ignorance then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering
and the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly when he sinneth by ignorance before the lord to make an atonement for him and it shall be forgiven him
ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance both for him that is born among the children of israel and for the stranger that sojourneth among them
but the soul that doeth ought presumptuously whether he be born in the land or a stranger the same reproacheth the lord and that soul shall be cut off from among his people
because he hath despised the word of the lord and hath broken his commandment that soul shall utterly be cut off his iniquity shall be upon him
and while the children of israel were in the wilderness they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day
and they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto moses and aaron and unto all the congregation
and they put him in ward because it was not declared what should be done to him
and the lord said unto moses the man shall be surely put to death all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp
and all the congregation brought him without the camp and stoned him with stones and he died as the lord commanded moses
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue
and it shall be unto you for a fringe that ye may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the lord and do them and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes after which ye use to go a whoring
that ye may remember and do all my commandments and be holy unto your god
i am the lord your god which brought you out of the land of egypt to be your god i am the lord your god
now korah the son of izhar the son of kohath the son of levi and dathan and abiram the sons of eliab and on the son of peleth sons of reuben took men
and they rose up before moses with certain of the children of israel two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly famous in the congregation men of renown
and they gathered themselves together against moses and against aaron and said unto them ye take too much upon you seeing all the congregation are holy every one of them and the lord is among them wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the lord
and when moses heard it he fell upon his face
and he spake unto korah and unto all his company saying even to morrow the lord will shew who are his and who is holy and will cause him to come near unto him even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him
this do take you censers korah and all his company
and put fire therein and put incense in them before the lord to morrow and it shall be that the man whom the lord doth choose he shall be holy ye take too much upon you ye sons of levi
and moses said unto korah hear i pray you ye sons of levi
seemeth it but a small thing unto you that the god of israel hath separated you from the congregation of israel to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the lord and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them
and he hath brought thee near to him and all thy brethren the sons of levi with thee and seek ye the priesthood also
for which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the lord and what is aaron that ye murmur against him
and moses sent to call dathan and abiram the sons of eliab which said we will not come up
is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us
moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards wilt thou put out the eyes of these men we will not come up
and moses was very wroth and said unto the lord respect not thou their offering i have not taken one ass from them neither have i hurt one of them
and moses said unto korah be thou and all thy company before the lord thou and they and aaron to morrow
and take every man his censer and put incense in them and bring ye before the lord every man his censer two hundred and fifty censers thou also and aaron each of you his censer
and they took every man his censer and put fire in them and laid incense thereon and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with moses and aaron
and korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the congregation
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying
separate yourselves from among this congregation that i may consume them in a moment
and they fell upon their faces and said o god the god of the spirits of all flesh shall one man sin and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the congregation saying get you up from about the tabernacle of korah dathan and abiram
and moses rose up and went unto dathan and abiram and the elders of israel followed him
and he spake unto the congregation saying depart i pray you from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs lest ye be consumed in all their sins
so they gat up from the tabernacle of korah dathan and abiram on every side and dathan and abiram came out and stood in the door of their tents and their wives and their sons and their little children
and moses said hereby ye shall know that the lord hath sent me to do all these works for i have not done them of mine own mind
if these men die the common death of all men or if they be visited after the visitation of all men then the lord hath not sent me
but if the lord make a new thing and the earth open her mouth and swallow them up with all that appertain unto them and they go down quick into the pit then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the lord
and it came to pass as he had made an end of speaking all these words that the ground clave asunder that was under them
and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their houses and all the men that appertained unto korah and all their goods
they and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit and the earth closed upon them and they perished from among the congregation
and all israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them for they said lest the earth swallow us up also
and there came out a fire from the lord and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest that he take up the censers out of the burning and scatter thou the fire yonder for they are hallowed
the censers of these sinners against their own souls let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar for they offered them before the lord therefore they are hallowed and they shall be a sign unto the children of israel
and eleazar the priest took the brasen censers wherewith they that were burnt had offered and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar
to be a memorial unto the children of israel that no stranger which is not of the seed of aaron come near to offer incense before the lord that he be not as korah and as his company as the lord said to him by the hand of moses
but on the morrow all the congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron saying ye have killed the people of the lord
and it came to pass when the congregation was gathered against moses and against aaron that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation and behold the cloud covered it and the glory of the lord appeared
and moses and aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation
and the lord spake unto moses saying
get you up from among this congregation that i may consume them as in a moment and they fell upon their faces
and moses said unto aaron take a censer and put fire therein from off the altar and put on incense and go quickly unto the congregation and make an atonement for them for there is wrath gone out from the lord the plague is begun
and aaron took as moses commanded and ran into the midst of the congregation and behold the plague was begun among the people and he put on incense and made an atonement for the people
and he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was stayed
now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred beside them that died about the matter of korah
and aaron returned unto moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the plague was stayed
and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the children of israel and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods write thou every man's name upon his rod
and thou shalt write aaron's name upon the rod of levi for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers
and thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony where i will meet with you
and it shall come to pass that the man's rod whom i shall choose shall blossom and i will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of israel whereby they murmur against you
and moses spake unto the children of israel and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece for each prince one according to their fathers houses even twelve rods and the rod of aaron was among their rods
and moses laid up the rods before the lord in the tabernacle of witness
and it came to pass that on the morrow moses went into the tabernacle of witness and behold the rod of aaron for the house of levi was budded and brought forth buds and bloomed blossoms and yielded almonds
and moses brought out all the rods from before the lord unto all the children of israel and they looked and took every man his rod
and the lord said unto moses bring aaron's rod again before the testimony to be kept for a token against the rebels and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me that they die not
and moses did so as the lord commanded him so did he
and the children of israel spake unto moses saying behold we die we perish we all perish
whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the lord shall die shall we be consumed with dying
and the lord said unto aaron thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood
and thy brethren also of the tribe of levi the tribe of thy father bring thou with thee that they may be joined unto thee and minister unto thee but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness
and they shall keep thy charge and the charge of all the tabernacle only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar that neither they nor ye also die
and they shall be joined unto thee and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation for all the service of the tabernacle and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you
and ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar that there be no wrath any more upon the children of israel
and i behold i have taken your brethren the levites from among the children of israel to you they are given as a gift for the lord to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation
therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office for everything of the altar and within the vail and ye shall serve i have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death
and the lord spake unto aaron behold i also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of israel unto thee have i given them by reason of the anointing and to thy sons by an ordinance for ever
this shall be thine of the most holy things reserved from the fire every oblation of theirs every meat offering of theirs and every sin offering of theirs and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render unto me shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons
in the most holy place shalt thou eat it every male shall eat it it shall be holy unto thee
and this is thine the heave offering of their gift with all the wave offerings of the children of israel i have given them unto thee and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee by a statute for ever every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it
all the best of the oil and all the best of the wine and of the wheat the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the lord them have i given thee
and whatsoever is first ripe in the land which they shall bring unto the lord shall be thine every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it
every thing devoted in israel shall be thine
every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh which they bring unto the lord whether it be of men or beasts shall be thine nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem
and those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem according to thine estimation for the money of five shekels after the shekel of the sanctuary which is twenty gerahs
but the firstling of a cow or the firstling of a sheep or the firstling of a goat thou shalt not redeem they are holy thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire for a sweet savour unto the lord
and the flesh of them shall be thine as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine
all the heave offerings of the holy things which the children of israel offer unto the lord have i given thee and thy sons and thy daughters with thee by a statute for ever it is a covenant of salt for ever before the lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee
and the lord spake unto aaron thou shalt have no inheritance in their land neither shalt thou have any part among them i am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of israel
and behold i have given the children of levi all the tenth in israel for an inheritance for their service which they serve even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation
neither must the children of israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation lest they bear sin and die
but the levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation and they shall bear their iniquity it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations that among the children of israel they have no inheritance
but the tithes of the children of israel which they offer as an heave offering unto the lord i have given to the levites to inherit therefore i have said unto them among the children of israel they shall have no inheritance
and the lord spake unto moses saying
thus speak unto the levites and say unto them when ye take of the children of israel the tithes which i have given you from them for your inheritance then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the lord even a tenth part of the tithe
and this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor and as the fulness of the winepress
thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the lord of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of israel and ye shall give thereof the lord's heave offering to aaron the priest
out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the lord of all the best thereof even the hallowed part thereof out of it
therefore thou shalt say unto them when ye have heaved the best thereof from it then it shall be counted unto the levites as the increase of the threshingfloor and as the increase of the winepress
and ye shall eat it in every place ye and your households for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation
and ye shall bear no sin by reason of it when ye have heaved from it the best of it neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of israel lest ye die
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying
this is the ordinance of the law which the lord hath commanded saying speak unto the children of israel that they bring thee a red heifer without spot wherein is no blemish and upon which never came yoke
and ye shall give her unto eleazar the priest that he may bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face
and eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times
and one shall burn the heifer in his sight her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung shall he burn
and the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer
then the priest shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp and the priest shall be unclean until the even
and he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh in water and shall be unclean until the even
and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of israel for a water of separation it is a purification for sin
and he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even and it shall be unto the children of israel and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them for a statute for ever
he that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days
he shall purify himself with it on the third day and on the seventh day he shall be clean but if he purify not himself the third day then the seventh day he shall not be clean
whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead and purifieth not himself defileth the tabernacle of the lord and that soul shall be cut off from israel because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him he shall be unclean his uncleanness is yet upon him
this is the law when a man dieth in a tent all that come into the tent and all that is in the tent shall be unclean seven days
and every open vessel which hath no covering bound upon it is unclean
and whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields or a dead body or a bone of a man or a grave shall be unclean seven days
and for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel
and a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it upon the tent and upon all the vessels and upon the persons that were there and upon him that touched a bone or one slain or one dead or a grave
and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day and on the seventh day he shall purify himself and wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean at even
but the man that shall be unclean and shall not purify himself that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the lord the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him he is unclean
and it shall be a perpetual statute unto them that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even
and whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even
then came the children of israel even the whole congregation into the desert of zin in the first month and the people abode in kadesh and miriam died there and was buried there
and there was no water for the congregation and they gathered themselves together against moses and against aaron
and the people chode with moses and spake saying would god that we had died when our brethren died before the lord
and why have ye brought up the congregation of the lord into this wilderness that we and our cattle should die there
and wherefore have ye made us to come up out of egypt to bring us in unto this evil place it is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates neither is there any water to drink
and moses and aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and they fell upon their faces and the glory of the lord appeared unto them
and the lord spake unto moses saying
take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink
and moses took the rod from before the lord as he commanded him
and moses and aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock and he said unto them hear now ye rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock
and moses lifted up his hand and with his rod he smote the rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron because ye believed me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of israel therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which i have given them
this is the water of meribah because the children of israel strove with the lord and he was sanctified in them
and moses sent messengers from kadesh unto the king of edom thus saith thy brother israel thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us
how our fathers went down into egypt and we have dwelt in egypt a long time and the egyptians vexed us and our fathers
and when we cried unto the lord he heard our voice and sent an angel and hath brought us forth out of egypt and behold we are in kadesh a city in the uttermost of thy border
let us pass i pray thee through thy country we will not pass through the fields or through the vineyards neither will we drink of the water of the wells we will go by the king's high way we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed thy borders
and edom said unto him thou shalt not pass by me lest i come out against thee with the sword
and the children of israel said unto him we will go by the high way and if i and my cattle drink of thy water then i will pay for it i will only without doing anything else go through on my feet
and he said thou shalt not go through and edom came out against him with much people and with a strong hand
thus edom refused to give israel passage through his border wherefore israel turned away from him
and the children of israel even the whole congregation journeyed from kadesh and came unto mount hor
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in mount hor by the coast of the land of edom saying
aaron shall be gathered unto his people for he shall not enter into the land which i have given unto the children of israel because ye rebelled against my word at the water of meribah
take aaron and eleazar his son and bring them up unto mount hor
and strip aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron shall be gathered unto his people and shall die there
and moses did as the lord commanded and they went up into mount hor in the sight of all the congregation
and moses stripped aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron died there in the top of the mount and moses and eleazar came down from the mount
and when all the congregation saw that aaron was dead they mourned for aaron thirty days even all the house of israel
and when king arad the canaanite which dwelt in the south heard tell that israel came by the way of the spies then he fought against israel and took some of them prisoners
and israel vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand then i will utterly destroy their cities
and the lord hearkened to the voice of israel and delivered up the canaanites and they utterly destroyed them and their cities and he called the name of the place hormah
and they journeyed from mount hor by the way of the red sea to compass the land of edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way
and the people spake against god and against moses wherefore have ye brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loatheth this light bread
and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of israel died
therefore the people came to moses and said we have sinned for we have spoken against the lord and against thee pray unto the lord that he take away the serpents from us and moses prayed for the people
and the lord said unto moses make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he looketh upon it shall live
and moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived
and the children of israel set forward and pitched in oboth
and they journeyed from oboth and pitched at ijeabarim in the wilderness which is before moab toward the sunrising
from thence they removed and pitched in the valley of zared
from thence they removed and pitched on the other side of arnon which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the amorites for arnon is the border of moab between moab and the amorites
wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the lord what he did in the red sea and in the brooks of arnon
and at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of ar and lieth upon the border of moab
and from thence they went to beer that is the well whereof the lord spake unto moses gather the people together and i will give them water
then israel sang this song spring up o well sing ye unto it
the princes digged the well the nobles of the people digged it by the direction of the lawgiver with their staves and from the wilderness they went to mattanah
and from mattanah to nahaliel and from nahaliel to bamoth
and from bamoth in the valley that is in the country of moab to the top of pisgah which looketh toward jeshimon
and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites saying
let me pass through thy land we will not turn into the fields or into the vineyards we will not drink of the waters of the well but we will go along by the king's high way until we be past thy borders
and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through his border but sihon gathered all his people together and went out against israel into the wilderness and he came to jahaz and fought against israel
and israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessed his land from arnon unto jabbok even unto the children of ammon for the border of the children of ammon was strong
and israel took all these cities and israel dwelt in all the cities of the amorites in heshbon and in all the villages thereof
for heshbon was the city of sihon the king of the amorites who had fought against the former king of moab and taken all his land out of his hand even unto arnon
wherefore they that speak in proverbs say come into heshbon let the city of sihon be built and prepared
for there is a fire gone out of heshbon a flame from the city of sihon it hath consumed ar of moab and the lords of the high places of arnon
woe to thee moab thou art undone o people of chemosh he hath given his sons that escaped and his daughters into captivity unto sihon king of the amorites
we have shot at them heshbon is perished even unto dibon and we have laid them waste even unto nophah which reacheth unto medeba
thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorites
and moses sent to spy out jaazer and they took the villages thereof and drove out the amorites that were there
and they turned and went up by the way of bashan and og the king of bashan went out against them he and all his people to the battle at edrei
and the lord said unto moses fear him not for i have delivered him into thy hand and all his people and his land and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites which dwelt at heshbon
so they smote him and his sons and all his people until there was none left him alive and they possessed his land
and the children of israel set forward and pitched in the plains of moab on this side jordan by jericho
and balak the son of zippor saw all that israel had done to the amorites
and moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many and moab was distressed because of the children of israel
and moab said unto the elders of midian now shall this company lick up all that are round about us as the ox licketh up the grass of the field and balak the son of zippor was king of the moabites at that time
he sent messengers therefore unto balaam the son of beor to pethor which is by the river of the land of the children of his people to call him saying behold there is a people come out from egypt behold they cover the face of the earth and they abide over against me
come now therefore i pray thee curse me this people for they are too mighty for me peradventure i shall prevail that we may smite them and that i may drive them out of the land for i wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed and he whom thou cursest is cursed
and the elders of moab and the elders of midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand and they came unto balaam and spake unto him the words of balak
and he said unto them lodge here this night and i will bring you word again as the lord shall speak unto me and the princes of moab abode with balaam
and god came unto balaam and said what men are these with thee
and balaam said unto god balak the son of zippor king of moab hath sent unto me saying
behold there is a people come out of egypt which covereth the face of the earth come now curse me them peradventure i shall be able to overcome them and drive them out
and god said unto balaam thou shalt not go with them thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessed
and balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of balak get you into your land for the lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you
and the princes of moab rose up and they went unto balak and said balaam refuseth to come with us
and balak sent yet again princes more and more honourable than they
and they came to balaam and said to him thus saith balak the son of zippor let nothing i pray thee hinder thee from coming unto me
for i will promote thee unto very great honour and i will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me come therefore i pray thee curse me this people
and balaam answered and said unto the servants of balak if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the word of the lord my god to do less or more
now therefore i pray you tarry ye also here this night that i may know what the lord will say unto me more
and god came unto balaam at night and said unto him if the men come to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which i shall say unto thee that shalt thou do
and balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and went with the princes of moab
and god's anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the lord stood in the way for an adversary against him now he was riding upon his ass and his two servants were with him
and the ass saw the angel of the lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field and balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way
but the angel of the lord stood in a path of the vineyards a wall being on this side and a wall on that side
and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she thrust herself unto the wall and crushed balaam's foot against the wall and he smote her again
and the angel of the lord went further and stood in a narrow place where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left
and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she fell down under balaam and balaam's anger was kindled and he smote the ass with a staff
and the lord opened the mouth of the ass and she said unto balaam what have i done unto thee that thou hast smitten me these three times
and balaam said unto the ass because thou hast mocked me i would there were a sword in mine hand for now would i kill thee
and the ass said unto balaam am not i thine ass upon which thou hast ridden ever since i was thine unto this day was i ever wont to do so unto thee and he said nay
then the lord opened the eyes of balaam and he saw the angel of the lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and he bowed down his head and fell flat on his face
and the angel of the lord said unto him wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times behold i went out to withstand thee because thy way is perverse before me
and the ass saw me and turned from me these three times unless she had turned from me surely now also i had slain thee and saved her alive
and balaam said unto the angel of the lord i have sinned for i knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me now therefore if it displease thee i will get me back again
and the angel of the lord said unto balaam go with the men but only the word that i shall speak unto thee that thou shalt speak so balaam went with the princes of balak
and when balak heard that balaam was come he went out to meet him unto a city of moab which is in the border of arnon which is in the utmost coast
and balak said unto balaam did i not earnestly send unto thee to call thee wherefore camest thou not unto me am i not able indeed to promote thee to honour
and balaam said unto balak lo i am come unto thee have i now any power at all to say any thing the word that god putteth in my mouth that shall i speak
and balaam went with balak and they came unto kirjathhuzoth
and balak offered oxen and sheep and sent to balaam and to the princes that were with him
and it came to pass on the morrow that balak took balaam and brought him up into the high places of baal that thence he might see the utmost part of the people
and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams
and balak did as balaam had spoken and balak and balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram
and balaam said unto balak stand by thy burnt offering and i will go peradventure the lord will come to meet me and whatsoever he sheweth me i will tell thee and he went to an high place
and god met balaam and he said unto him i have prepared seven altars and i have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram
and the lord put a word in balaam's mouth and said return unto balak and thus thou shalt speak
and he returned unto him and lo he stood by his burnt sacrifice he and all the princes of moab
and he took up his parable and said balak the king of moab hath brought me from aram out of the mountains of the east saying come curse me jacob and come defy israel
how shall i curse whom god hath not cursed or how shall i defy whom the lord hath not defied
for from the top of the rocks i see him and from the hills i behold him lo the people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations
who can count the dust of jacob and the number of the fourth part of israel let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like his
and balak said unto balaam what hast thou done unto me i took thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast blessed them altogether
and he answered and said must i not take heed to speak that which the lord hath put in my mouth
and balak said unto him come i pray thee with me unto another place from whence thou mayest see them thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shalt not see them all and curse me them from thence
and he brought him into the field of zophim to the top of pisgah and built seven altars and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar
and he said unto balak stand here by thy burnt offering while i meet the lord yonder
and the lord met balaam and put a word in his mouth and said go again unto balak and say thus
and when he came to him behold he stood by his burnt offering and the princes of moab with him and balak said unto him what hath the lord spoken
and he took up his parable and said rise up balak and hear hearken unto me thou son of zippor
god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good
behold i have received commandment to bless and he hath blessed and i cannot reverse it
he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob neither hath he seen perverseness in israel the lord his god is with him and the shout of a king is among them
god brought them out of egypt he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn
surely there is no enchantment against jacob neither is there any divination against israel according to this time it shall be said of jacob and of israel what hath god wrought
behold the people shall rise up as a great lion and lift up himself as a young lion he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey and drink the blood of the slain
and balak said unto balaam neither curse them at all nor bless them at all
but balaam answered and said unto balak told not i thee saying all that the lord speaketh that i must do
and balak said unto balaam come i pray thee i will bring thee unto another place peradventure it will please god that thou mayest curse me them from thence
and balak brought balaam unto the top of peor that looketh toward jeshimon
and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams
and balak did as balaam had said and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar
and when balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless israel he went not as at other times to seek for enchantments but he set his face toward the wilderness
and balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes and the spirit of god came upon him
and he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beor hath said and the man whose eyes are open hath said
he hath said which heard the words of god which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance but having his eyes open
how goodly are thy tents o jacob and thy tabernacles o israel
as the valleys are they spread forth as gardens by the river's side as the trees of lign aloes which the lord hath planted and as cedar trees beside the waters
he shall pour the water out of his buckets and his seed shall be in many waters and his king shall be higher than agag and his kingdom shall be exalted
god brought him forth out of egypt he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn he shall eat up the nations his enemies and shall break their bones and pierce them through with his arrows
he couched he lay down as a lion and as a great lion who shall stir him up blessed is he that blesseth thee and cursed is he that curseth thee
and balak's anger was kindled against balaam and he smote his hands together and balak said unto balaam i called thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast altogether blessed them these three times
therefore now flee thou to thy place i thought to promote thee unto great honour but lo the lord hath kept thee back from honour
and balaam said unto balak spake i not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me saying
if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the commandment of the lord to do either good or bad of mine own mind but what the lord saith that will i speak
and now behold i go unto my people come therefore and i will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days
and he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beor hath said and the man whose eyes are open hath said
he hath said which heard the words of god and knew the knowledge of the most high which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance but having his eyes open
i shall see him but not now i shall behold him but not nigh there shall come a star out of jacob and a sceptre shall rise out of israel and shall smite the corners of moab and destroy all the children of sheth
and edom shall be a possession seir also shall be a possession for his enemies and israel shall do valiantly
out of jacob shall come he that shall have dominion and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city
and when he looked on amalek he took up his parable and said amalek was the first of the nations but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever
and he looked on the kenites and took up his parable and said strong is thy dwellingplace and thou puttest thy nest in a rock
nevertheless the kenite shall be wasted until asshur shall carry thee away captive
and he took up his parable and said alas who shall live when god doeth this
and ships shall come from the coast of chittim and shall afflict asshur and shall afflict eber and he also shall perish for ever
and balaam rose up and went and returned to his place and balak also went his way
and israel abode in shittim and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of moab
and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bowed down to their gods
and israel joined himself unto baalpeor and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel
and the lord said unto moses take all the heads of the people and hang them up before the lord against the sun that the fierce anger of the lord may be turned away from israel
and moses said unto the judges of israel slay ye every one his men that were joined unto baalpeor
and behold one of the children of israel came and brought unto his brethren a midianitish woman in the sight of moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of israel who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
and when phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest saw it he rose up from among the congregation and took a javelin in his hand
and he went after the man of israel into the tent and thrust both of them through the man of israel and the woman through her belly so the plague was stayed from the children of israel
and those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand
and the lord spake unto moses saying
phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest hath turned my wrath away from the children of israel while he was zealous for my sake among them that i consumed not the children of israel in my jealousy
wherefore say behold i give unto him my covenant of peace
and he shall have it and his seed after him even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was zealous for his god and made an atonement for the children of israel
now the name of the israelite that was slain even that was slain with the midianitish woman was zimri the son of salu a prince of a chief house among the simeonites
and the name of the midianitish woman that was slain was cozbi the daughter of zur he was head over a people and of a chief house in midian
and the lord spake unto moses saying
vex the midianites and smite them
for they vex you with their wiles wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of peor and in the matter of cozbi the daughter of a prince of midian their sister which was slain in the day of the plague for peor's sake
and it came to pass after the plague that the lord spake unto moses and unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest saying
take the sum of all the congregation of the children of israel from twenty years old and upward throughout their fathers house all that are able to go to war in israel
and moses and eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho saying

unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names
to many thou shalt give the more inheritance and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him
notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit
according to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided between many and few
and these are they that were numbered of the levites after their families of gershon the family of the gershonites of kohath the family of the kohathites of merari the family of the merarites
these are the families of the levites the family of the libnites the family of the hebronites the family of the mahlites the family of the mushites the family of the korathites and kohath begat amram
and the name of amram's wife was jochebed the daughter of levi whom her mother bare to levi in egypt and she bare unto amram aaron and moses and miriam their sister
and unto aaron was born nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar
and nadab and abihu died when they offered strange fire before the lord
and those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand all males from a month old and upward for they were not numbered among the children of israel because there was no inheritance given them among the children of israel
these are they that were numbered by moses and eleazar the priest who numbered the children of israel in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho
but among these there was not a man of them whom moses and aaron the priest numbered when they numbered the children of israel in the wilderness of sinai
for the lord had said of them they shall surely die in the wilderness and there was not left a man of them save caleb the son of jephunneh and joshua the son of nun
then came the daughters of zelophehad the son of hepher the son of gilead the son of machir the son of manasseh of the families of manasseh the son of joseph and these are the names of his daughters mahlah noah and hoglah and milcah and tirzah
and they stood before moses and before eleazar the priest and before the princes and all the congregation by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation saying
our father died in the wilderness and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the lord in the company of korah but died in his own sin and had no sons
why should the name of our father be done away from among his family because he hath no son give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father
and moses brought their cause before the lord
and the lord spake unto moses saying
the daughters of zelophehad speak right thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them
and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel saying if a man die and have no son then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter
and if he have no daughter then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren
and if he have no brethren then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren
and if his father have no brethren then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family and he shall possess it and it shall be unto the children of israel a statute of judgment as the lord commanded moses
and the lord said unto moses get thee up into this mount abarim and see the land which i have given unto the children of israel
and when thou hast seen it thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people as aaron thy brother was gathered
for ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of zin in the strife of the congregation to sanctify me at the water before their eyes that is the water of meribah in kadesh in the wilderness of zin
and moses spake unto the lord saying
let the lord the god of the spirits of all flesh set a man over the congregation
which may go out before them and which may go in before them and which may lead them out and which may bring them in that the congregation of the lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd
and the lord said unto moses take thee joshua the son of nun a man in whom is the spirit and lay thine hand upon him
and set him before eleazar the priest and before all the congregation and give him a charge in their sight
and thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him that all the congregation of the children of israel may be obedient
and he shall stand before eleazar the priest who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of urim before the lord at his word shall they go out and at his word they shall come in both he and all the children of israel with him even all the congregation
and moses did as the lord commanded him and he took joshua and set him before eleazar the priest and before all the congregation
and he laid his hands upon him and gave him a charge as the lord commanded by the hand of moses
and the lord spake unto moses saying
command the children of israel and say unto them my offering and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire for a sweet savour unto me shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season

and moses told the children of israel according to all that the lord commanded moses
and moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of israel saying this is the thing which the lord hath commanded
if a man vow a vow unto the lord or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth
if a woman also vow a vow unto the lord and bind herself by a bond being in her father's house in her youth
and her father hear her vow and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand
but if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth not any of her vows or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand and the lord shall forgive her because her father disallowed her
and if she had at all an husband when she vowed or uttered ought out of her lips wherewith she bound her soul
and her husband heard it and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it then her vows shall stand and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand
but if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it then he shall make her vow which she vowed and that which she uttered with her lips wherewith she bound her soul of none effect and the lord shall forgive her
but every vow of a widow and of her that is divorced wherewith they have bound their souls shall stand against her
and if she vowed in her husband's house or bound her soul by a bond with an oath
and her husband heard it and held his peace at her and disallowed her not then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand
but if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows or concerning the bond of her soul shall not stand her husband hath made them void and the lord shall forgive her
every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul her husband may establish it or her husband may make it void
but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day then he establisheth all her vows or all her bonds which are upon her he confirmeth them because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them
but if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them then he shall bear her iniquity
these are the statutes which the lord commanded moses between a man and his wife between the father and his daughter being yet in her youth in her father's house
and the lord spake unto moses saying
avenge the children of israel of the midianites afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people
and moses spake unto the people saying arm some of yourselves unto the war and let them go against the midianites and avenge the lord of midian
of every tribe a thousand throughout all the tribes of israel shall ye send to the war
so there were delivered out of the thousands of israel a thousand of every tribe twelve thousand armed for war
and moses sent them to the war a thousand of every tribe them and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest to the war with the holy instruments and the trumpets to blow in his hand
and they warred against the midianites as the lord commanded moses and they slew all the males
and they slew the kings of midian beside the rest of them that were slain namely evi and rekem and zur and hur and reba five kings of midian balaam also the son of beor they slew with the sword
and the children of israel took all the women of midian captives and their little ones and took the spoil of all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods
and they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt and all their goodly castles with fire
and they took all the spoil and all the prey both of men and of beasts
and they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil unto moses and eleazar the priest and unto the congregation of the children of israel unto the camp at the plains of moab which are by jordan near jericho
and moses and eleazar the priest and all the princes of the congregation went forth to meet them without the camp
and moses was wroth with the officers of the host with the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds which came from the battle
and moses said unto them have ye saved all the women alive
behold these caused the children of israel through the counsel of balaam to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peor and there was a plague among the congregation of the lord
now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him
but all the women children that have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves
and do ye abide without the camp seven days whosoever hath killed any person and whosoever hath touched any slain purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day
and purify all your raiment and all that is made of skins and all work of goats hair and all things made of wood
and eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle this is the ordinance of the law which the lord commanded moses
only the gold and the silver the brass the iron the tin and the lead
every thing that may abide the fire ye shall make it go through the fire and it shall be clean nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water
and ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and ye shall be clean and afterward ye shall come into the camp
and the lord spake unto moses saying
take the sum of the prey that was taken both of man and of beast thou and eleazar the priest and the chief fathers of the congregation
and divide the prey into two parts between them that took the war upon them who went out to battle and between all the congregation
and levy a tribute unto the lord of the men of war which went out to battle one soul of five hundred both of the persons and of the beeves and of the asses and of the sheep
take it of their half and give it unto eleazar the priest for an heave offering of the lord
and of the children of israel's half thou shalt take one portion of fifty of the persons of the beeves of the asses and of the flocks of all manner of beasts and give them unto the levites which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the lord
and moses and eleazar the priest did as the lord commanded moses
and the booty being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep
and threescore and twelve thousand beeves
and threescore and one thousand asses
and thirty and two thousand persons in all of women that had not known man by lying with him
and the half which was the portion of them that went out to war was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep
and the lord's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen
and the beeves were thirty and six thousand of which the lord's tribute was threescore and twelve
and the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred of which the lord's tribute was threescore and one
and the persons were sixteen thousand of which the lord's tribute was thirty and two persons
and moses gave the tribute which was the lord's heave offering unto eleazar the priest as the lord commanded moses
and of the children of israel's half which moses divided from the men that warred
now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep
and thirty and six thousand beeves
and thirty thousand asses and five hundred
and sixteen thousand persons
even of the children of israel's half moses took one portion of fifty both of man and of beast and gave them unto the levites which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the lord as the lord commanded moses
and the officers which were over thousands of the host the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds came near unto moses
and they said unto moses thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge and there lacketh not one man of us
we have therefore brought an oblation for the lord what every man hath gotten of jewels of gold chains and bracelets rings earrings and tablets to make an atonement for our souls before the lord
and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of them even all wrought jewels
and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the lord of the captains of thousands and of the captains of hundreds was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels
for the men of war had taken spoil every man for himself
and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation for a memorial for the children of israel before the lord
now the children of reuben and the children of gad had a very great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of jazer and the land of gilead that behold the place was a place for cattle
the children of gad and the children of reuben came and spake unto moses and to eleazar the priest and unto the princes of the congregation saying
ataroth and dibon and jazer and nimrah and heshbon and elealeh and shebam and nebo and beon
even the country which the lord smote before the congregation of israel is a land for cattle and thy servants have cattle
wherefore said they if we have found grace in thy sight let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession and bring us not over jordan
and moses said unto the children of gad and to the children of reuben shall your brethren go to war and shall ye sit here
and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of israel from going over into the land which the lord hath given them
thus did your fathers when i sent them from kadeshbarnea to see the land
for when they went up unto the valley of eshcol and saw the land they discouraged the heart of the children of israel that they should not go into the land which the lord had given them
and the lord's anger was kindled the same time and he sware saying
surely none of the men that came up out of egypt from twenty years old and upward shall see the land which i sware unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob because they have not wholly followed me
save caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite and joshua the son of nun for they have wholly followed the lord
and the lord's anger was kindled against israel and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the lord was consumed
and behold ye are risen up in your fathers stead an increase of sinful men to augment yet the fierce anger of the lord toward israel
for if ye turn away from after him he will yet again leave them in the wilderness and ye shall destroy all this people
and they came near unto him and said we will build sheepfolds here for our cattle and cities for our little ones
but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of israel until we have brought them unto their place and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land
we will not return unto our houses until the children of israel have inherited every man his inheritance
for we will not inherit with them on yonder side jordan or forward because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side jordan eastward
and moses said unto them if ye will do this thing if ye will go armed before the lord to war
and will go all of you armed over jordan before the lord until he hath driven out his enemies from before him
and the land be subdued before the lord then afterward ye shall return and be guiltless before the lord and before israel and this land shall be your possession before the lord
but if ye will not do so behold ye have sinned against the lord and be sure your sin will find you out
build you cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth
and the children of gad and the children of reuben spake unto moses saying thy servants will do as my lord commandeth
our little ones our wives our flocks and all our cattle shall be there in the cities of gilead
but thy servants will pass over every man armed for war before the lord to battle as my lord saith
so concerning them moses commanded eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of israel
and moses said unto them if the children of gad and the children of reuben will pass with you over jordan every man armed to battle before the lord and the land shall be subdued before you then ye shall give them the land of gilead for a possession
but if they will not pass over with you armed they shall have possessions among you in the land of canaan
and the children of gad and the children of reuben answered saying as the lord hath said unto thy servants so will we do
we will pass over armed before the lord into the land of canaan that the possession of our inheritance on this side jordan may be ours
and moses gave unto them even to the children of gad and to the children of reuben and unto half the tribe of manasseh the son of joseph the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites and the kingdom of og king of bashan the land with the cities thereof in the coasts even the cities of the country round about
and the children of gad built dibon and ataroth and aroer
and atroth shophan and jaazer and jogbehah
and bethnimrah and bethharan fenced cities and folds for sheep
and the children of reuben built heshbon and elealeh and kirjathaim
and nebo and baalmeon their names being changed and shibmah and gave other names unto the cities which they builded
and the children of machir the son of manasseh went to gilead and took it and dispossessed the amorite which was in it
and moses gave gilead unto machir the son of manasseh and he dwelt therein
and jair the son of manasseh went and took the small towns thereof and called them havothjair
and nobah went and took kenath and the villages thereof and called it nobah after his own name
these are the journeys of the children of israel which went forth out of the land of egypt with their armies under the hand of moses and aaron
and moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the lord and these are their journeys according to their goings out
and they departed from rameses in the first month on the fifteenth day of the first month on the morrow after the passover the children of israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the egyptians
for the egyptians buried all their firstborn which the lord had smitten among them upon their gods also the lord executed judgments
and the children of israel removed from rameses and pitched in succoth
and they departed from succoth and pitched in etham which is in the edge of the wilderness
and they removed from etham and turned again unto pihahiroth which is before baalzephon and they pitched before migdol
and they departed from before pihahiroth and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness and went three days journey in the wilderness of etham and pitched in marah

and they removed from mount shapher and encamped in haradah
and they removed from haradah and pitched in makheloth
and they removed from makheloth and encamped at tahath
and they departed from tahath and pitched at tarah
and they removed from tarah and pitched in mithcah

and they went from horhagidgad and pitched in jotbathah
and they removed from jotbathah and encamped at ebronah
and they departed from ebronah and encamped at eziongaber
and they removed from eziongaber and pitched in the wilderness of zin which is kadesh
and they removed from kadesh and pitched in mount hor in the edge of the land of edom
and aaron the priest went up into mount hor at the commandment of the lord and died there in the fortieth year after the children of israel were come out of the land of egypt in the first day of the fifth month
and aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount hor
and king arad the canaanite which dwelt in the south in the land of canaan heard of the coming of the children of israel
and they departed from mount hor and pitched in zalmonah
and they departed from zalmonah and pitched in punon
and they departed from punon and pitched in oboth

and they departed from iim and pitched in dibongad
and they removed from dibongad and encamped in almondiblathaim
and they removed from almondiblathaim and pitched in the mountains of abarim before nebo
and they departed from the mountains of abarim and pitched in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho
and they pitched by jordan from bethjesimoth even unto abelshittim in the plains of moab
and the lord spake unto moses in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho saying
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye are passed over jordan into the land of canaan
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and quite pluck down all their high places
and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for i have given you the land to possess it
and ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit
but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then it shall come to pass that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell
moreover it shall come to pass that i shall do unto you as i thought to do unto them
and the lord spake unto moses saying
command the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land of canaan this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance even the land of canaan with the coasts thereof
then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of zin along by the coast of edom and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward
and your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of akrabbim and pass on to zin and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to kadeshbarnea and shall go on to hazaraddar and pass on to azmon
